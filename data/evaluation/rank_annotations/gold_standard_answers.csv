What is the association between GERD and gluten ?,N/A,"Food intolerance is a common complaint amongst patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs), including those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567359)
There is a great interest in the role of a major dietary protein, gluten, in the production of symptoms (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567359)
several published studies have consistently shown the efficacy of a gluten-free diet in rapidly controlling esophageal symptoms and in preventing their recurrence (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21438963)
Since the participation of gluten in the esophageal symptoms of CD seems clear, its intimate mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, and several hypothesis have been proposed, including the specific immune alterations characterizing CD, the reduction in nutrient absorption determining the arrival of intact gluten to distal gastrointestinal segments, and various dysregulations in the function of gastrointestinal hormones and peptides. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21438963)
Celiac disease (CD) patients often complain of symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We aimed to assess the prevalence of GERD symptoms at diagnosis and to determine the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20601132)
: At diagnosis, celiac patients had a significantly higher reflux symptom mean score than healthy controls (P < .001). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20601132)
Moderate to severe symptoms were significantly associated with the classical clinical presentation of CD (35.0%)  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20601132)
GERD symptoms are common in classically symptomatic untreated CD patients. The GFD is associated with a rapid and persistent improvement in reflux symptoms that resembles the healthy population. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20601132)
Effect of gluten-free diet on preventing recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease-related symptoms in adult celiac patients with nonerosive reflux disease. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18853995)
The present study is the first to have evaluated the effect of a GFD in the nonerosive form of GERD in CD patients, by means of clinical long-term follow-up, suggesting that GFD could be a useful approach in reducing GERD symptoms and in the prevention of recurrence. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18853995)
Altogether, 0.9% of patients with oesophagitis and 0.6% of those with oesophageal reflux symptoms had coeliac disease.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15316418)
The prevalence of oesophagitis was 5.2% in untreated coeliac disease, 5.6% in treated coeliac disease, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15316418)
In coeliac patients, the reflux symptoms were mild but nevertheless were alleviated on a gluten-free diet. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15316418)
The association between these two conditions is, at most, weak, but a gluten-free diet may still bring symptomatic relief for reflux symptoms in coeliac disease (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15316418)"
Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?,[no],"Genomic DNA is used as the template for both replication and transcription, whose machineries may collide and result in mutagenesis, among other damages. Because head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, genes should be preferentially encoded on the leading strand to avoid head-on collisions, as is observed in most bacterial genomes examined. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24273314)
Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538833)
The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22735706)
genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22735706)
genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22735706)
essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20417622)
remarkable strand-bias of the distribution of essential genes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20417622)
Head-on encounters between the replication and transcription machineries on the lagging DNA strand can lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and replication are co-directional. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21350489)
Replication-associated purine asymmetry may contribute to strand-biased gene distribution. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532183)
strand-biased gene distribution (SGD) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532183)
SGD correlates not only with polC, but also with purine asymmetry (PAS) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532183)
In bacteria, most genes are on the leading strand of replication, a phenomenon attributed to collisions between the DNA and RNA polymerases. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15942025)
genes whose expression is important for fitness are selected to the leading strand because this reduces the duration of these interruptions (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15942025)
Among prokaryotic genomes, the distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork is known to be biased.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532183)
We show that the evidence they provided is invalid and that the existence of lagging strand encoded genes is explainable by a balance between deleterious mutations that bring genes from the leading to the lagging strand and purifying selection purging such mutants. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24273314)
Based on those experimentally determined for 10 bacteria, we find that essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand, for all the 10 genomes studied, confirming previous findings based on either smaller datasets or putatively assigned ones by homology search. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20417622)
The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22735706)
Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538833)
This paradox could be explained by assuming that the stronger mutation pressure and selection after inversion preferentially eliminate genes transferred from the leading to the lagging DNA strand. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11677621)
We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11677621)

Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under experimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and the elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the leading/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15823418)"
Is there any link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates?,[yes],"Some of the most highly conserved sequences occur in genes encoding RNA binding proteins, particularly the RNA splicing-associated SR genes. Differences in sequence conservation between plants and animals are likely to reflect differences in the biology of the organisms, with plants being much more able to tolerate genomic deletions and whole-genome duplication events due, in part, to their far greater fecundity compared with vertebrates.

Which molecule is targeted by the drug Gevokizumab?,[IL-1β],"Detailed mechanistic analysis of gevokizumab, an allosteric anti-IL-1β antibody with differential receptor-modulating properties. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24194526)
Gevokizumab is a potent anti-IL-1β antibody being developed as a treatment for diseases in which IL-1β has been associated with pathogenesis. Previous data indicated that gevokizumab negatively modulates IL-1β signaling through an allosteric mechanism.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24194526)
These data indicate, therefore, that gevokizumab is a unique inhibitor of IL-1β signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1β-associated autoinflammatory diseases. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24194526)
Most recently, rising evidence reports on the use of adalimumab, etanercept, and golimumab, while use of anti-interleukin (IL)-1 agents (anakinra, canakinumab, gevokizumab), IL-6 blockers (tocilizumab), and rituximab (depleting anti-CD20 antibody) is also increasing. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23729309)
One target-two different binding modes: structural insights into gevokizumab and canakinumab interactions to interleukin-1β. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23041424)
Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1β monoclonal antibodies.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23041424)
Gevokizumab is claimed to be a regulatory therapeutic antibody that modulates IL-1β bioactivity by reducing the affinity for its IL-1RI:IL-1RAcP signaling complex. How IL-1β signaling is affected by both canakinumab and gevokizumab was not yet experimentally determined. We have analyzed the crystal structures of canakinumab and gevokizumab antibody binding fragment (Fab) as well as of their binary complexes with IL-1β.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23041424)
In contrast, gevokizumab occupies an allosteric site on IL-1β and complex formation results in a minor reduction of binding affinity to IL-1RI. This suggests two different mechanisms of IL-1β pathway attenuation. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23041424)
Gevokizumab is a novel, human-engineered monoclonal anti-IL-1β antibody.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699287)
Interleukin-1β-regulating antibody XOMA 052 (gevokizumab) in the treatment of acute exacerbations of resistant uveitis of Behcet's disease: an open-label pilot study. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22084392)
This pilot study aimed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of XOMA 052 (gevokizumab), a recombinant humanised anti-interleukin 1β antibody, in Behçet's disease patients with uveitis.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22084392)
Gevokizumab, an anti-IL-1β mAb for the potential treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154167)
XOMA is developing gevokizumab (XOMA-052), an IgG2 humanized mAb against human IL-1β, for the potential treatment of these diseases. Gevokizumab has a high affinity for IL-1β and a long t1/2, which would allow for once-monthly dosing and offer a considerable advantage for patients over agents requiring more frequent dosing. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154167)
To meet these challenges, we developed XOMA 052 (gevokizumab), a potent anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibody that was designed in silico and humanized using Human Engineering™ technology.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21048425)
In the present study, we measured the impact of gevokizumab on the IL-1β system using Schild analysis and surface plasmon resonance studies, both of which demonstrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinity of IL-1β for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) signaling receptor, but not the IL-1 counter-regulatory decoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type II).

Which protein pathway is regulating SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3a to control cell proliferation?,[The mTOR pathway],"The mTOR pathway controls cell proliferation by regulating the FoxO3a transcription factor via SGK1 kinase (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558442)
the FoxO3a transcription factor is coordinately regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2, and plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558442)
mTORC1, in coordination with mTORC2, controls cell proliferation by regulating FoxO3a gene expression and SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Ser314 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558442)
These results suggest that mTORC1, in coordination with mTORC2, controls cell proliferation by regulating FoxO3a gene expression and SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Ser314 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558442)
SGK1 overexpression suppressed CDKI expression in p18-deficient cells, whereas SGK1 knockdown induced CDKI expression in wild-type cells, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation. These results suggest that mTORC1, in coordination with mTORC2, controls cell proliferation by regulating FoxO3a gene expression and SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Ser314.

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24170634)
Recently, in addition to the two currently approved U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medications (minoxidil and finasteride), a novel device was FDA-approved for the treatment of hair loss, the laser hair comb. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21061765)
In addition, low-level light therapy (LLLT) has recently been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hair loss.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20689478)
Currently there are two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents that promote hair regrowth: over-the-counter topical minoxidil solution for men and women and prescription oral finasteride tablets for men.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12410672)
Topical monoxidil and oral finasteride are commonly in use and have FDA approval for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia; dutasteride, a type I and II 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, is on hold in Phase III trials. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20426708)
The only FDA-approved dermatological indication of finasteride is androgenetic alopecia. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20300365)

Which protein is affected by dusp8 activation?,[JNK],"Thus, rosiglitazone's neuroprotective effect after ischemia is mediated by blocking JNK phosphorylation induced by ischemia via DUSP8 upregulation. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23032483)
Prevention of JNK phosphorylation as a mechanism for rosiglitazone in neuroprotection after transient cerebral ischemia: activation of dual specificity phosphatase. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23032483)
These results suggest that JNK activation by H(2)O(2) plus PDTC resulted from the down-regulation of JNK phosphatases. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11313966)
M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11566103)
Phosphorylation of the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase enhances the activation of JNK by arsenite. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22100391)
Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22100391)
Both anisomycin and arsenite activate the JNK pathway and, in addition, inactivate the M3/6 phosphatase. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11948422)
M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23159405)
. We suggest that reduction of HSP70 by expanded polyglutamine is implicated in aggregation and inhibition of M3/6 and in activation of JNK and AP-1. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12598532)"

These results indicate that the mouse Gsdma and Gsdma3 genes share common function to regulate epithelial maintenance  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23979942)
Gasdermin (GSDM or GSDMA), expressed in the upper gastrointestinal tract but frequently silenced in gastric cancers (GCs), regulates apoptosis of the gastric epithelium. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19051310)
. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that gasdermins are expressed specifically in cells at advanced stages of differentiation in the upper epidermis, the differentiating inner root sheath and hair shaft and in the most mature sebocytes of the sebaceous gland and preputial, meibomium, ceruminous gland, and anal glands. This expression pattern suggests a role for gasdermins in differentiation of the epidermis and its appendages. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15737203)"
Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria?,"[Mfd]
[NusA]","Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22427630)
Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is involved in correcting UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand. Mutation frequency decline (Mfd) is a transcription repair coupling factor, involved in repair of template strand during transcription. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559463)
the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20436399)
We report observations suggesting that the transcription elongation factor NusA promotes a previously unrecognized class of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) in addition to its previously proposed role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20696893)
NusA participates in an alternative class of TCR involved in the identification and removal of a class of lesion, such as the N(2)-f-dG lesion (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20696893)
Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22960746)
Transcription-coupled repair, the targeted repair of the transcribed strands of active genes, is defective in bacteria, yeast, and human cells carrying mutations in mfd, RAD26 and ERCC6, respectively. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8807287)
The effect of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, at such lesions is not known: it has been suggested that Mfd may promote mutagenesis by increasing the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses non-bulky lesions, but it has also been reported that 8-oxoguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18707026)
The transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene) is a widely conserved bacterial protein that mediates transcription-coupled DNA repair. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702425)
Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrA.

The bacterial Mfd protein is a transcription-repair coupling factor that performs two key functions during transcription-coupled DNA repair. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15687384)
Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22960746)
Transcription and DNA repair are coupled in E. coli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12086674)
The first is to remove RNA polymerase (RNAP) complexes that have been stalled by a DNA lesion from the site of damage, and the second is to mediate the recruitment of DNA repair proteins. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15687384)
Coupling of transcription and DNA repair in bacteria is mediated by transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene), which removes transcription elongation complexes stalled at DNA lesions and recruits the nucleotide excision repair machinery to the site. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469698)
Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22960746)
Mfd may act through a translocase activity that rewinds upstream DNA, leading either to translocation or to release of RNA polymerase when the enzyme active site cannot continue elongation. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12086674)
Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17572090)
E. coli Transcription repair coupling factor (Mfd protein) rescues arrested complexes by promoting forward translocation. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12086674)

We also found that the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd promotes direct restart of the fork after the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20110508)

Are there interactomes available for POU5F1 and SOX2?,[yes],"The interactomes of POU5F1 and SOX2 enhancers in human embryonic stem cells. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549118)
We assayed long-range chromosomal interactions on putative enhancers of POU5F1 and SOX2 genes in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using 4C-Seq technique. We discovered that their frequent interacting regions mainly overlap with early DNA replication domains. The interactomes are associated with active histone marks and enriched with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine sites. In hESCs, genes within the interactomes have elevated expression. Additionally, some genes associated with the POU5F1 enhancer contribute to pluripotency. Binding sites for multiple DNA binding proteins, including ATF3, CTCF, GABPA, JUND, NANOG, RAD21 and YY1, are enriched in both interactomes. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549118)"

The oligonucleotide probes are renewable, highly efficient, and able to robustly label chromosomes in cell culture, fixed tissues, and metaphase spreads. Our method gives researchers precise control over the sequences they target and allows for single and multicolor imaging of regions ranging from tens of kilobases to megabases with the same basic protocol. We anticipate this technology will lead to an enhanced ability to visualize interphase and metaphase chromosomes. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23236188)

ChIP-sequencing data mapped onto skipped exon events reveal a correlation between histone H3K36 trimethylation peaks and skipped exons, suggesting epigenetic marks being part of alternative splicing regulation. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23676078)
Vezf1 interacts with Mrg15/Mrgbp, a protein that recognizes H3K36 trimethylation, consistent with the role of histone modifications at alternatively spliced sites (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22308494)
H2BK123ub1 is also a feature of introns in the yeast genome, and the disruption of this modification alters the intragenic distribution of H3 trimethylation on lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which functionally correlates with alternative RNA splicing in humans (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22188810)

Which is the main regulatory molecule of SERCA2A function in the cardiac muscle?,"[Phospholamban, PLN, plb]","SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25451386)
SERCA2a activity can be regulated at multiple levels of a signaling cascade comprised of phospholamban (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23710633)
Phospholamban (PLN), the reversible inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), is a key regulator of myocyte Ca(2+) cycling with a significant role in heart failure. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21266500)

Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the activity of SERCA2a, the Ca(2+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca(2+). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19948724)
Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19112098)
phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19112098)
SERCA2a activity is regulated by phosphorylation of another SR protein: Phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN inhibits SERCA2a. Phosphorylation of PLN by either cAMP or cGMP-dependent protein kinase at Ser16 or the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), at Thr17, relieves this inhibition, increasing SR Ca2+ uptake and SR Ca2+ load.

We found recurrent mutations in NOTCH1, a finding that we confirmed in an extension cohort of 108 clinical samples and 8 cell lines. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210878)
We found activating mutations in Notch in more than 30% of ATL patients. These activating mutations are phenotypically different from those previously reported in T-ALL leukemias and may represent polymorphisms for activated Notch in human cancers. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20823234)
We detected Notch1 missense mutations in 8.3% of the tumors (only in the posterior fossa location and in case of 9q33-34 gain). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19289631)
Importantly, mutations of the Notch protein and components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (T-cell leukemia and other cancers, Multiple Sclerosis, CADASIL, Alagille Syndrome, Spondylocostal Dysostosis). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17584081)
Here, we demonstrate that endothelial-specific deletion of Jag1 leads to cardiovascular defects in both embryonic and adult mice that are reminiscent of those in Alagille syndrome. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23095891)
In this study, analysis of 21 Vietnamese ALGS individuals led to the identification of 19 different mutations (18 JAG1 and 1 NOTCH2), 17 of which are novel, including the third reported NOTCH2 mutation in Alagille Syndrome. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22488849)
Genetics of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a congenital malformation of the developing human forebrain, is due to multiple genetic defects. Most genes that have been implicated in HPE belong to the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Here we describe a new candidate gene isolated from array comparative genomic hybridization redundant 6qter deletions, DELTA Like 1 (DLL1), which is a ligand of NOTCH. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21196490)
Four genes causing a subset of autosomal recessive forms of this disease have been identified: DLL3 (SCDO1: MIM 277300), MESP2 (SCDO2: MIM 608681), LFNG (SCDO3: MIM609813) and HES7 (SCDO4). These genes are all essential components of the Notch signalling pathway, which has multiple roles in development and disease. Previously, only a single SCD-causative missense mutation was described in HES7. In this study, we have identified two new missense mutations in the HES7 gene in a single family, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20087400)

Alagille syndrome (AGS) is caused by mutations in the gene for the Notch signaling pathway ligand Jagged1 (JAG1), which are found in 94% of patients. To identify the cause of disease in patients without JAG1 mutations, we screened 11 JAG1 mutation-negative probands with AGS for alterations in the gene for the Notch2 receptor (NOTCH2). We found NOTCH2 mutations segregating in two families and identified five affected individuals. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16773578)
Mutations in the JAG1 (Jagged 1) gene, coding a ligand in the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway, are responsible for AGS. Here we present sixteen different JAG1 gene mutations, among them twelve novel, not described previously. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15712272)
Altogether 226 different JAG1 mutations have been described in association with AGS, including our novel 36 mutations. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12497640)
Previous studies have demonstrated that a wide spectrum of JAG1 mutations result in AGS. These include total gene deletions, protein truncating, splicing and missense mutations which are distributed across the coding region of the gene. Here we present results of JAG1 mutation screening by SSCP and FISH in 105 patients with AGS. For these studies, new primers were designed for 12 exons. Mutations were identified in 63/105 patients (60%) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11180599)
We have screened 54 AGS probands and family members to determine the frequency of mutations in JAG1. Three patients (6%) had deletions of the entire gene. Of the remaining 51 patients, 35 (69%) had mutations within JAG1, identified by SSCP analysis. Of the 35 identified intragenic mutations, all were unique, with the exceptions of a 5-bp deletion in exon 16, seen in two unrelated patients, and a C insertion at base 1618 in exon 9, also seen in two unrelated patients. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9585603)
Analyses of many patients with cytogenetic deletions or rearrangements have mapped the gene to chromosome 20p12, although deletions are found in a relatively small proportion of patients (< 7%). We have mapped the human Jagged1 gene (JAG1), encoding a ligand for the developmentally important Notch transmembrane receptor, to the Alagille syndrome critical region within 20p12.

Compared with placebo, topical minoxidil caused significant increases in LV end-diastolic volume, in cardiac output (by 0.751 min-1) and in LV mass (by 5 g m-2). We conclude that in healthy subjects short-term use of topical minoxidil is likely not to be detrimental. However, safety needs to be established regarding ischaemic symptoms in patients with coronary artery disease as well as for the possible development of LV hypertrophy in healthy subjects during years of therapy. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3191000)
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are mild scalp dryness and irritation and, rarely, allergic contact dermatitis. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3311578)
Eight deaths that occurred during Upjohn-sponsored clinical trials of topical minoxidil and two deaths in subjects who used extemporaneous formulations of the drug are summarized. Of the eight patients in clinical trials, five had cardiovascular abnormalities and two had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related pneumonia. One patient died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. One of the subjects who was using extemporaneous topical minoxidil had hypertension and arteriosclerotic disease and the other died of a myocardial infarction. There is little likelihood of significant adverse effects attributable to topical minoxidil because of its low systemic absorption. The evidence suggests that these deaths were the result of causes other than use of the drug. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3549808)
Only 2% of prescribers reported complications other than local irritation that they associated with topical minoxidil therapy, but underreporting of noncutaneous side effects in this survey of dermatologists cannot be excluded. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3800424)
Typical side effects of this topical treatment include irritative dermatitis going along with pruritus, erythema, scaling and dryness, which occur especially at the onset of the therapy. In some cases, allergic contact dermatitis or exacerbation of seborrheic dermatitis has been reported. While most of the patients with allergic contact dermatitis described in the literature showed a positive sensitization to the vehicle substance propylene glycol evaluated by patch testing, reactions to the active ingredient minoxidil are rare (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15982234)"

Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of facultative heterochromatin?,"[H3K9me3]

[H3K36me3]","We used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (""ChIP-seq"") of DNA associated with the centromere-specific histone H3, CENP-A (CenH3), to identify centromeric DNA, and ChIP-seq with antibodies against dimethylated H3K4, trimethylated H3K9 and trimethylated H3K27 to determine the relative distribution and proportion of euchromatin, obligate and facultative heterochromatin, respectively (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26430472)
Dramatic changes in exposure of a repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me2, indicate that during development linker histone plays a role in establishing the facultative heterochromatin territory and architecture in the nucleus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23645681)
We show here that the maternally inherited Snurf-Snrpn 3-Mb region, which is silenced by a potent transcription repressive mechanism, is uniformly enriched in histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin, such as H4K20me3, H3K9me3, and H3K79me3. Strikingly, we found that trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which was previously identified as a hallmark of actively transcribed regions, is deposited onto the silenced, maternally contributed 3-Mb imprinted region (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21803857)
Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 is associated with constitutive and facultative heterochromatin. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21803857)
In addition, we demonstrate that H3K36me3 is markedly enriched at the level of pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21803857)
Remarkably, H3K9me3 is predominant in coding regions of active genes, a phenomenon that is not restricted to the X chromosome. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16648823)
We detected the H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 modifications, with H3K27me3, which is indicative of facultative heterochromatin, exhibiting the highest enrichment on all viral promoters tested.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19515781)

Can RNAPolII function as an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase?,[yes],"RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23395899)
RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23395899)
. Our studies provide compelling evidence that mammalian Pol II acts as an RdRP to control the stability of a cellular RNA by extending its 3'-end. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23395899)
here is, however, evidence that Pol II also possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18004386)
The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18004386)
The present findings provide a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanistic principles of transcription by a viral RNA polymerase and have implications for the regulation of Pol II activities in infected cells. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15827195)
Influenza A virus transcribes its segmented negative sense RNA genome in the nuclei of infected cells in a process long known to require host RNA polymerase II (RNAP-II). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17132145)
We conclude that influenza A virus replication requires RNAP-II activity not just to provide capped mRNA substrates but also to facilitate nuclear export of selected viral mRNAs. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17132145)
Thus, influenza virus specifically interferes with Pol II elongation, but not Pol II initiation. We propose that influenza virus RNA polymerase, by binding to the CTD of initiating Pol II and subsequent cleavage of the capped 5' end of the nascent transcript, triggers premature Pol II termination. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16624367)
We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) preinitiation complex recruitment and H3 Lys 4 (H3-K4) methylation at the Xist promoter form the basis of the Xist expression profiles that drives both imprinted and random XCI. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15964997)

Our understanding of the molecular processes which regulate cardiac function has grown immeasurably in recent years. Even with the advent of β-blockers, angiotensin inhibitors and calcium modulating agents, heart failure (HF) still remains a seriously debilitating and life-threatening condition. Here, we review the molecular changes which occur in the heart in response to increased load and the pathways which control cardiac hypertrophy, calcium homeostasis, and immune activation during HF. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875630)
Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are G-protein coupled receptors which maintain systemic calcium homeostasis and participate in hormone secretion, activation of ion channels, cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23554644)
CaSRs are associated with I/R injury and apoptosis in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes via suppressing Bcl-2 and promoting caspase-3 expression. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23554644)
Important insights into the molecular basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and related diseases have been gained by studying families with inherited cardiac hypertrophy. Integrated clinical and genetic investigations have demonstrated that different genetic defects can give rise to the common phenotype of cardiac hypertrophy. Diverse pathways have been identified, implicating perturbations in force generation, force transmission, intracellular calcium homeostasis, myocardial energetics, and cardiac metabolism in causing disease (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20347784)

Calcium ions are the most ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Calcium homeostasis and signaling systems are crucial for both the normal growth of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the intricate working of the mammalian heart.

With aging, the heart develops myocyte hypertrophy associated with impaired relaxation indices. To define the cellular basis of this adaptation, we examined the physiological changes that arise in calcium handling in the aging heart and contrasted the adaptations that occur following the imposition of a stimulus that alters calcium homeostasis in a young and an old heart (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18172603)
alterations in the calcium-handling machinery of the cardiocyte differ in the context of age and as such may predispose the older heart to the development of a hypertrophic phenotype. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18172603)
The cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX1) is a key sarcolemmal protein for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the heart.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517353)
Thus exchanger overexpression in mice leads to abnormal calcium handling and a decompensatory transition to heart failure with stress (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517353)
Central to controlling intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) are a number of Ca(2+) transporters and channels with the L-type Ca(2+) channel, Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) being of particular note in the heart. This review concentrates on the regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) in cardiac muscle and the homeostatic mechanisms employed to ensure that the heart can operate under steady-state conditions on a beat by beat basis. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17509680)
the tight regulation of SR Ca(2+) content is also required to prevent the abnormal, spontaneous or diastolic release of Ca(2+) from the SR. Such diastolic events are a major factor contributing to the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias in disease situations and in recently identified familial mutations in the SR Ca(2+) release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17509680)
Calcium channels have a unique functional role, because not only do they participate in this activity, they form the means by which electrical signals are converted to responses within the cell. Calcium channels play an integral role in excitation in the heart and shaping the cardiac action potential. In addition, calcium influx through calcium channels is responsible for initiating contraction. Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis underlie cardiac arrhythmia, contractile dysfunction and cardiac remodelling.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17353151)

Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?,[yes],"This study reports the consequences of LT4 treatment over a prolonged period of time in 2 of the first patients with a heterozygous mutation in TRα1. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23633213)
Here we show that the dysregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis was worsened by the lack of TR alpha1 in TR betaPV mice, and severe impairment of postnatal growth was manifested in TR betaPV mice deficient in TR alpha1. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12750454)
Heterozygous 2- to 3-week- old mice exhibit a severe retardation of post-natal development and growth, but only a minor reduction in serum thyroxine levels.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12356724)
The data demonstrate a novel array of effects mediated by a dominant negative TRalpha1, and may provide important clues for identification of a potentially unrecognized human disorder and its treatment. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12356724)
No mutations in DNA- and hormone-binding-domains of TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 genes were found in proband, suggesting that the defect could be due to an unknown mutation in either the TR gene or a post receptor abnormality (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17906375)
These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice. Therefore, TR alpha1 could play a compensatory role in mediating the functions of T3 in heterozygous patients with RTH.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12750454)"

From which sequence does the Alu repeat originate from?,[7SL RNA],"The origin of Alu-derived minisatellites appears to have been mediated by short flanking repeats, as first proposed by Haber and Louis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343813)
Finally, we propose that the origin of Alu subfamilies in human populations may be related to evolution of chromosome Y. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12167372)
Our analysis indicates that about 60 Myr ago, before the prosimian divergence, free left and right monomers formed an Alu heterodimer connected by a 19-nucleotide-long A-rich linker. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9694666)
the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8576966)

stress-induced preferential translation of Hsp70 mRNA is negatively regulated by PI3K-mTORC1 signaling (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177857)
Conversely, Hsp70 synthesis is enhanced under the reduced PI3K-mTORC1 signaling (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177857)
Our findings imply a plausible mechanism for how persistent PI3K-mTORC1 signaling favors the development of age-related pathologies by attenuating stress resistance (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177857)
One prominent example is the selective translation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) under stress conditions. Although the transcriptional regulation of Hsp genes has been well established, neither the specific translation-promoting features nor the regulatory mechanism of the translation machinery have been clearly defined. Here we show that the stress-induced preferential translation of Hsp70 mRNA is negatively regulated by PI3K-mTORC1 signaling.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177857)

What are the Topological Domains (TADs)?,N/A,"We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.

What is the enzymatic activity of the breast cancer associated gene BRCA1?,[E3 ubiquitin ligase activity],"E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is the only known enzymatic activity of BRCA1, which is mediated by the N-terminal RING finger domain. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20681793)
BRCA1 nuclear transport and ubiquitin E3 ligase enzymatic activity are tightly regulated by the BRCA1 dimeric binding partner BARD1 and further modulated by cancer mutations and diverse signaling pathways. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24278741)
E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is not essential for mammalian cell viability or homology-directed repair of double-strand DNA breaks. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19088202)
The protein encoded by BRCA1 interacts in vivo with the related BARD1 protein to form a heterodimeric complex that acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Because the enzymatic activity of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is conserved over a broad phylogenetic range, it is thought to be critical for the central functions of BRCA1. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19088202)
A mechanism for transcriptional repression dependent on the BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17420471)
In this study, we identified an ubiquitin-dependent mechanism by which BRCA1 inhibits transcription. BRCA1 ubiquitinates the transcriptional preinitiation complex, preventing stable association of TFIIE and TFIIH, and thus blocks the initiation of mRNA synthesis.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17420471)
In the structure the arrangement of the Ring-domains is similar to another H2A E3 ligase, the BRCA1/BARD1 complex, but complex formation depends on an N-terminal arm of Ring1b that embraces the Bmi1 Ring-domain. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16710298)
Discovering the precise function of the breast and ovarian specific tumor suppressor, BRCA1, has proven to be quite complicated. It has been determined that BRCA1, together with BARD1, comprise an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Since it is now known that BRCA1 is an enzyme, the challenge for BRCA1 research is to learn how this enzymatic activity functions in normal breast and ovarian cells in order to suppress cancerous transformation. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16479151)
The BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene is expressed in all mammalian cells. Within these cells, the BRCA1 protein product interacts with several seemingly distinct nuclear complexes. Proteins within these complexes are potential targets for the E3-ubiquitin ligase activity associated with BRCA1:BARD1 complexes.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254397)
During both DNA replication and DNA repair, BRCA1 appears to serve both adaptor and enzymatic functions. Roles include transient physical recruitment of NBS1, gammaH2AX, FANCD2 and other proteins in specific repair associated complexes, and enzymatic activity as an E3-ubiquitin ligase against a subset of these proteins.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254397)

Is there any link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B?,[yes],"The aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B combine to regulate active promoters in quiescent lymphocytes. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24034696)
We show that the Aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein Ring1B have essential roles in regulating transcriptionally active genes in quiescent lymphocytes. Ring1B and Aurora B bind to a wide range of active promoters in resting B and T cells. Conditional knockout of either protein results in reduced transcription and binding of RNA Pol II to promoter regions and decreased cell viability. Aurora B phosphorylates histone H3S28 at active promoters in resting B cells as well as inhibiting Ring1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes. Our results identify a mechanism for regulating transcription in quiescent cells that has implications for epigenetic regulation of the choice between proliferation and quiescence.

To what extent does HPV vaccination reduce the risk for cervical cancer?,[Cervical precancer and similar neoplasias were reduced by 84-100%],"The success of HPV vaccination as a major public health prevention opportunity, however, will entirely depend on efficient infrastructures to deliver the vaccines and on the acceptance by individuals, parents and health care providers. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17318575)
The most effective strategy therein was vaccination of 12-year-olds, plus a temporary 12-24-year-old catch-up program covering both sexes; whereby HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical cancer, high-grade cervical precancer, and genital wart incidence was reduced by 84-98% during year 50 following vaccine introduction (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18055075)
the introduction of cervical screening programs, the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer has been drastically reduced (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18482556)
On the assumption that the vaccine provided lifelong immunity, the cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination of 12-year-old girls was $43,600 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, as compared with the current screening practice (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18716299)
Vaccine efficacy in prevention of CIN 2 or higher lesions in HPV 16 or HPV 18 negative women, who received all vaccination doses, ranges between 98% and 100% (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21289891)

Organized vaccination programs against HPV have the potential to prevent about 70% of cervical cancers and the vast majority of the other HPV-related conditions.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21245659)
However, existing data strongly suggests that as many as 440,000 cervical cancer cases and 220,000 deaths due to this malignancy will be prevented with the establishment of an effective worldwide HPV immunization program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23016781)
Prophylactic HPV vaccination against HPV 16 and 18 has been shown to be highly effective in preventing HPV related malignancy in clinical trials (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19200838)
Nevertheless women up to 45 years of age have been shown to exhibit strong immune responses to the bivalent HPV vaccine which might be expected to reduce the risk of HPV re-infection and address the second peak of HPV related malignancy in later life, evident over 45 years of age (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19200838)

NovoTTF Therapy is a novel and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM with potential benefits compared with other options. Recurrent GBM patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single-agent NovoTTF Therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and OS. In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields). The overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase III trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25213870)

The median time to in-field progression was 28 weeks and the median time to systemic progression was 22 weeks. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23891283)
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TTFields and pemetrexed as a second line therapy for NSCLC is safe and potentially more effective than pemetrexed alone.

The antimitotic effect of TTFields therapy has been demonstrated in multiple cell lines when the appropriate frequency was utilized. A phase III trial of TTFields monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients established that TTFields therapy is associated with minimal toxicity, better quality of life, and comparable efficacy to chemotherapy. Ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFields in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, solid tumor brain metastases, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and ovarian and pancreatic cancers.

Long-term survival of patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme treated with tumor-treating fields. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23095807)
Tumor-treating fields (TTField) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received CE and FDA approval for the treatment of RGBM, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 kHz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types. Our center was the first to apply TTField treatment to histologically proven GBM in a small pilot study of 20 individuals in 2004 and 2005, and four of those original 20 patients are still alive today. We report two cases of GBM and two cases of RGBM treated by TTField therapy, all in good health and no longer receiving any treatment more than seven years after initiating TTField therapy, with no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23095807)

Furthermore, it summarizes the clinical experience with TTFields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized Phase III trial TTFields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): TTFields significantly improved median overall survival (OS) compared with standard therapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21548832)
The second indication was a Phase II study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where TTFields was administered concomitantly with pemetrexed.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21548832)
EXPERT OPINION: The proof of concept of TTFields has been well demonstrated in the preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor types.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21548832)
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that TTFields alone and in combination with paclitaxel and doxorubicin effectively reduce the viability of both wild type and MDR cell sub-lines and thus can potentially be used as an effective treatment of drug resistant tumors.

Outcomes showed 1 partial response of a treated skin metastasis from a primary breast cancer, 3 cases where tumor growth was arrested during treatment, and 1 case of disease progression. One mesothelioma patient experienced lesion regression near TTFields with simultaneous tumor stability or progression in distal areas.CONCLUSION: Although the number of patients in this study is small, the lack of therapy toxicity and the efficacy observed in data gathered to date indicate the potential of TTFields as a new treatment modality for solid tumors, definitely warranting further investigation.

Mitotic disruption and reduced clonogenicity of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by tumor treating fields. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555979)
OBJECTIVES: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a non-invasive cancer treatment modality approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The present study determined the efficacy and mechanism of action of TTFields in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555979)
RESULTS: Application of TTFields in vitro showed a significant decrease in cell count, an increase in cell volume and reduced clonogenicity. Further analysis demonstrated significant increase in the number of abnormal mitotic figures, as well as a decrease in G2-M cell population. In hamsters with orthotopic pancreatic tumors, TTFields significantly reduced tumor volume accompanied by an increase in the frequency of abnormal mitotic events. TTFields efficacy was enhanced both in vitro and in vivo when combined with chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that TTFields serve as an effective antimitotic treatment in preclinical pancreatic cancer models and have a long term negative effect on cancer cell survival. These results make TTFields an attractive candidate for testing in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555979)

What is the role of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone in the treatment of comatose patients?,N/A,"Despite the correction of these metabolic disorders, the patient became comatose, and MRI, on T2 weighted image, showed hyperintense signals in the basal ganglia consistent with extra-pontine myelinolysis. The patient's state remained unchanged for six weeks. Since S. Konno and H. Wakui published cases of myelinolysis who dramatically improved after TRH treatment, the patient was given 0.6 mg i.v daily of TRH for six weeks. Improvement began within a few days, and continued until complete recovery. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9773038)

[Montirelin hydrate (NS-3), a TRH analog, improved the disturbance of consciousness caused by head concussion and pentobarbital in mice]. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8690305)
NS-3 shortened the latent periods to the recovery of the righting reflex (0.03-0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) and spontaneous motor activity (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) following the head concussion. In the case of TRH, higher doses were needed to induce such effects. NS-3 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed the pentobarbital-induced narcosis in a dose-dependent manner. A similar effect was elicited by 30- to 100-fold higher doses of TRH than NS-3. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8690305)
Taken together with the finding that NS-3 did not bind to dopamine, adrenaline or muscarine receptors, it is suggested that NS-3 may restore the disturbance of consciousness by activating the brain dopamine, noradrenaline and acetylcholine neurons without stimulating these receptors directly.

A 46-year-old female motorcyclist, who suffered injuries to the brain stem in a traffic accident, showed hypotensive and bradycardiac responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) given to counter consciousness disturbance. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1394244)
The direct TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) stimulation to the anterior lobe was responded to well.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1317658)
The neuropharmacological activities of TRH include an interesting arousal effect and an analeptic action on generalized depression of the CNS whether this depression is of natural origin, such as hibernation, or induced pharmacologically (barbiturates, ethanol) or of a traumatic origin (coma). This analeptic action is attributable to stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the septo-hippocampal area and to the presence of terminals containing TRH in the lateral septum and TRH receptors concentrated especially in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca. It has also been suggested that TRH localized in the pineal gland has a part in activating the neuronal mechanisms of arousal. Associated with the arousal effect and especially evident in variously originated shock conditions are the activating effects of TRH on vegetative functions (body temperature, circulation, the gastrointestinal tract). These stimulatory activities on the CNS were the rationale for therapeutic use of TRH in the initial treatment of coma due to brain trauma and for the treatment of endogenous depression.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2127684)
In the vegetative group, TRH caused significant increases in MBP (from 91 +/- 8 mm Hg to 110 +/- 10 mm Hg) at 2 min after the injection [p < 0.05, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Scheffé F-test]. In contrast, five of the seven BD patient showed no alterations in the measured parameter in response to the TRH injection. However, the remaining two BD patients, who had spinal reflexes, exhibited an elevation in MBP.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8221703)
These results indicate that in comatose patients, the hemodynamic effects of TRH may differ depending on impairments in the central nervous system; the results support previous reports indicating a mediation of the central sympathetic nervous system in the development of pressor effects of TRH.

Gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (EC 3.4.24.35) cleaves many substrates and is produced by most cell types as a zymogen (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25360794)
Extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases involved in physiological and pathological processes, through the cleavage of extracellular matrix. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22257051)
Extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptydases which recquire a zinc ion at their active site, for proteolityc activity. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23001203)"
What are the skeletal muscle satellite cells?,N/A,"Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) are Pax7(+) myogenic stem cells that reside between the basal lamina and the plasmalemma of the myofiber. In mature muscles, SCs are typically quiescent, but can be activated in response to muscle injury. Depending on the magnitude of tissue trauma, SCs may divide minimally to repair subtle damage within individual myofibers or produce a larger progeny pool that forms new myofibers in cases of overt muscle injury (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26074812)
Satellite cells (SC) are quiescent adult muscle stem cells critical for postnatal development (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25732238)
Satellite cells are multipotential stem cells that mediate postnatal muscle growth and respond differently to temperature based upon aerobic versus anaerobic fiber-type origin (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26341996)
Skeletal muscle mass, function, and repair capacity all progressively decline with aging, restricting mobility, voluntary function, and quality of life. Skeletal muscle repair is facilitated by a population of dedicated muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, that reside in anatomically defined niches within muscle tissues. In adult tissues, MuSCs are retained in a quiescent state until they are primed to regenerate damaged muscle through cycles of self-renewal divisions (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26248268)
Muscle satellite cells are a stem cell population required for postnatal skeletal muscle development and regeneration, accounting for 2-5% of sublaminal nuclei in muscle fibers. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747722)
Skeletal muscle satellite cells are adult muscle-derived stem cells receiving increasing attention. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22233500)
Skeletal muscle satellite cells are quiescent mononucleated myogenic cells, located between the sarcolemma and basement membrane of terminally-differentiated muscle fibres. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12757751)
The acquisition of a proliferating-cell status from a quiescent state as well as the shift between proliferation and differentiation are key developmental steps in skeletal-muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to provide proper muscle regeneration (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26055324)
Satellite cells are essential for skeletal muscle regeneration as they ultimately provide the myogenic precursors that rebuild damaged muscle tissue (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439806)
Skeletal muscle satellite cells are committed to myogenesis and do not spontaneously adopt nonmyogenic fates. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21339173)
These are normally quiescent in adult muscle, but act as a reserve population of cells, able to proliferate in response to injury and give rise to regenerated muscle and to more satellite cells. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12757751)
Satellite cell-derived muscle precursor cells may be used to repair and regenerate damaged or myopathic skeletal muscle, or to act as vectors for gene therapy. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12757751)
Research focusing on the canonical adult myogenic progenitor, the skeletal muscle satellite cell, is still an ever-growing field 46 years from their initial description. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17996437)
 Skeletal muscle satellite cells, located between the basal lamina and plasma membrane of myofibers, are required for skeletal muscle regeneration. The capacity of satellite cells as well as other cell lineages including mesoangioblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and side population (SP) cells to contribute to muscle regeneration has complicated the identification of a satellite stem cell. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19265661)
 Muscle satellite cells are a stem cell population required for postnatal skeletal muscle development and regeneration, accounting for 2-5% of sublaminal nuclei in muscle fibers. In adult muscle, satellite cells are normally mitotically quiescent. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747722)
 Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue composed of non-dividing, multi-nucleated muscle fibres that contract to generate force in a controlled and directed manner. Skeletal muscle is formed during embryogenesis from a subset of muscle precursor cells, which generate both differentiated muscle fibres and specialized muscle-forming stem cells known as satellite cells. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21727135)
 Skeletal muscle satellite cells are adult muscle-derived stem cells receiving increasing attention. Sheep satellite cells have a greater similarity to human satellite cells with regard to metabolism, life span, proliferation and differentiation, than satellite cells of the rat and mouse.

Which  is the execution time (complexity) of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for the alignment of two sequences,[quadratic],"The problem of finding an optimal structural alignment for a pair of superimposed proteins is often amenable to the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm, which runs in time proportional to the product of lengths of the sequences being aligned. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21714130)
While this result is not an asymptotic improvement over the original Smith-Waterman algorithm, its complexity is characterized in terms of some sparse features of the matrix and it yields the fastest software implementation to date for such searches. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12804086)
If we use N, M and C to represent the size of an amino acid sequence, the size of a structure template, and the maximum cut size of long-range interactions, respectively, the algorithm finds an optimal structure-sequence alignment in O(21C NM) time, a polynomial function of N and M when C = O(log(N + M)). When running on structure-sequence alignment problems without long-range intersections, i.e. C = 0, the algorithm achieves the same asymptotic computational complexity of the Smith-Waterman sequence-sequence alignment algorithm. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9021270)
The algorithm is based on fractional programming and its running time is O(n2log n). In practice, normalized local alignment is only 3-5 times slower than the standard Smith-Waterman algorithm. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11301301)"
Are adenylyl cyclases always transmembrane proteins?,[no],"ransmembrane adenylyl cyclase (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25350397)
 Transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) and soluble AC (sAC)  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220136)
Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is a recently recognized source of the signaling molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP) that is genetically and biochemically distinct from the classic G-protein-regulated transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574382)
Soluble adenylyl cyclase  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009261)
transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs), and soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC).  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009261)
 Here, we showed that both transmembrane AC (tmAC) and soluble AC (sAC) are distinctly involved in the regulation of sperm motility in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073090)
cAMP production in beta cells is mediated not simply by transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (TMACs), but also by sAC. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24980705)
In contrast to tmAC, sAC produces cAMP in various intracellular microdomains close to specific cAMP targets, e.g., in nucleus and mitochondria (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010002)
soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC, ADCY10), the ubiquitous, non-transmembrane adenylyl cyclase, was found to play a key role in neuronal survival and axon growth. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25064589)

How does thyroid hormone regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium?,N/A,"L-T3 significantly increased the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, in the LV peri-infarct zone (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20100314)
the T(3)-induced phosphorylation of p38 and AMPK in both slow- and fast-twitch skeletal muscles suggests that these events may be important in mediating hormone-induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17962579)
Our findings indicate parallel increases in myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis with 15-day T4 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15543939)
The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15543939)
T3 mediates an early stimulation of enzymes containing mtDNA encoded subunits (e.g. complex IV and V) in contrast to a different regulatory pattern for the entirely nuclear-encoded enzymes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15893763)
Activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha), were significantly elevated with 72 h T3 treatment (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15893763)
T(3) increased PGC-1alpha content similarly in both fast- and slow-twitch muscle, as well as in the liver, but not in heart. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12734114)
Thyroid hormone [3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T(3))] induces phenotypic alterations in cardiac mitochondria, in part by influencing protein import and the expression of the import motor mitochondrial heat shock protein (mtHsp70). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388124)
These findings indicate that import machinery components are differentially regulated in response to stimuli that induce mitochondrial biogenesis, like T(3) and differentiation. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388124)
We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor (p43) regulating mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis. When overexpressed in skeletal muscle, it increases mitochondrial DNA content, stimulates mitochondrial respiration, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22109994)
Here we show that a p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity in skeletal muscle (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22109994)
The contribution of TFAM, TFB2M, and helicase Twinkle in thyroid-induced mtDNA biogenesis was assessed. The activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis. The role of helicase Twinkle, the expression induction of which is also observed after triiodothyronine addition, remains unclear. The analysis of factors that activate TFAM and TFB2M expression showed that NRF-1 is the determinative regulator: (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21568860)
in rat cerebellum show that hypothyroidism causes reduction in expression of nuclear encoded genes controlling mitochondrial biogenesis like PGC-1alpha, NRF-1alpha and Tfam (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20515651)
These results thus indicate an integrated nuclear-mitochondrial cross talk in regulation of mitochondrial transcription by TH during brain development. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20515651)
T(3) acts to reduce cellular oxidative stress, which may help attenuate ROS-mediated damage, along with improving mitochondrial function and energy status in cells with mtDNA defects. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19036942)
These findings suggest the existence of compensatory mechanisms operating at the translational and/or post-translational levels which promote proliferation of mitochondria in the hypothyroid liver. However, when the liver mass was considered, hypothyroidism significantly reduced overall mitochondrial proliferation in rat liver. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7556180)
Total liver mitochondrial DNA levels in thyroid-treated animals were greater than age-paired controls by 79% at 7 days but only 67% at 14 days since a small gain occurred in control animals and no further increase occurred in treated rats during the second week. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6157679)
thyroid hormone treatment produces hyperplasia and an increase in mitochondrial number and mass in rat liver (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6157679)
It is concluded that T3 exerts a direct, rather than permissive, effect on mitochondrial biogenesis, and that high affinity binding sites for GH are not present in rat liver mitochondria. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2773621)
These data strengthen the view that thyroid hormone regulates synthesis of specific components within each respiratory-chain complex and that these products apparently play key roles in inner-membrane biogenesis and assembly (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1321044)
It is concluded that thyroid hormone causes an increase in the mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial cytochrome content, and respiratory rate, and consequently expands the capacity of oxidative metabolism without an uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation.

What is the mechanism of cementogenesis in pulp regeneration?,N/A,"New vital tissues can be regenerated in permanent canine teeth after pulpectomy and enlargement of the apical foramen (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23146645)
The loss of dental pulp may weaken teeth, rendering them susceptible to reinfection, fracture, and subsequent tooth loss. Therefore, regeneration of pulp is considered an ideal treatment to preserve teeth. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23146645)
Constitutive stabilization of ß-catenin in the dental mesenchyme leads to excessive dentin and cementum formation (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21854758)
Wnt/ß-catenin signaling plays an important role in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation during development. Essential roles of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in tooth morphogenesis have been well known (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21854758)
Our results indicate that persistent stabilization of ß-catenin in the dental mesenchyme leads to premature differentiation of odontoblasts and differentiation of cementoblasts, and induces excessive dentin and cementum formation in vivo. These results suggest that temporospatial regulation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling plays critical roles in the differentiation of odontoblasts and cementoblasts, and that inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling may be important for the formation of dentin and cementum during tooth development (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21854758)
Local modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling has therapeutic potential to improve the regeneration of dentin and periodontium (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21854758)
It is known that the dental follicle (DF) consists of progenitor cells that give rise to the cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21512722)
 but little information is available about the regulation of DF cell differentiation into either cementogenic or osteogenic cell lineages for the regeneration of diseased periodontal tissue. Here, we investigated the roles of DF, Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS), and pulp cells in the cementum (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21512722)
These results suggest that the combined use of DF, HERS, and pulp cells could direct DF cell differentiation into cementoblasts and/or osteoblasts in vivo, thus providing a novel strategy for the successful repair and regeneration of diseased periodontal tissue (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21512722)
 HERS cells played a role in the induction and maturation of cementum-like tissues formed by DF cells (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21512722)
 implants of DF cells in the presence of pulp cells led to the formation of bone-like tissues (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21512722)
Interestingly, in the presence of both HERS and pulp cells, DF cells formed both cementum-like and bone-like tissues. We demonstrated that while HERS cells are able to induce DF cell differentiation into cementoblasts and promote cementum formation, pulp cells could direct DF cell differentiation into osteoblasts and enhance alveolar bone formation (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21512722)
Periodontal ligament (PDL) and cementum complex and dentin pulp complex have been tissue engineered using human dental pulp stem cells and PDL stem cells (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636796)
Histological, immunohistochemical, and scanning electronic microscopy examinations results showed that bioengineered dentin could induce cementogenesis and PDL formation, and condense PDL arranged perpendicularly on the dentin surface via a layer of cementum-like tissue (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18636796)"
Which are the subunits of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the canonical pathway activation?,"[p65, RelA]
[p50, NF-κB1]","In this study, we demonstrated that the HSV-1 UL42 protein, a DNA polymerase processivity factor, was a novel antagonism of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. UL42 was shown to significantly suppress TNF-α mediated NF-κB activation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that UL42 bound to the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23636254)
Thus, it was first time we demonstrated that HSV-1 UL42 appeared to prevent NF-κB-dependent gene expression by retaining p65 and p50 in the cytoplasm, and UL42-dependent transcriptional activation were inherently coupled to promote HSV-1 lytic replication, which also may contribute to immune evasion and pathogenesis of HSV-1. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23636254)
The review describes NF-κB and its two pathways: the canonical, mediated by the p65 and p50 subunits, and the non-canonical, mediated by the subunits RelB, p52 and p50.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22726116)
The function of the TTV open reading frame (ORF) in the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway has not yet been established. In this study, we found for the first time that the TTV ORF2 protein could suppress NF-kappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner in the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. By Western blot analysis, we proved that the TTV ORF2 protein did not alter the level of NF-kappaB expression but prevented the p50 and p65 subunits from entering the nucleus due to the inhibition of IkappaBalpha protein degradation.

Neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines showed marked increases in p53 protein expression without transcriptional up-regulation (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15492248)
We then tested the p53 response pathway and observed that the neuroblastoma parent cells responded to genotoxic stress, whereas the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants did not. These results suggest that Ews/Fli-1 can directly abrogate the p53 pathway to promote tumorigenesis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15492248)

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25963655)
Extensive functional proteomic analysis established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator-RAG GTPases machinery. Gain of SLC38A9 function rendered cells resistant to amino acid withdrawal, whereas loss of SLC38A9 expression impaired amino-acid-induced mTORC1 activation. Thus SLC38A9 is a physical and functional component of the amino acid sensing machinery that controls the activation of mTOR. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25561175)

How many periods of regulatory innovation led to the evolution of vertebrates?,[Three],"Three periods of regulatory innovation during vertebrate evolution. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21852499)
To investigate the gain of regulatory elements throughout vertebrate evolution, we identified genome-wide sets of putative regulatory regions for five vertebrates, including humans. These putative regulatory regions are conserved nonexonic elements (CNEEs), which are evolutionarily conserved yet do not overlap any coding or noncoding mature transcript. We then inferred the branch on which each CNEE came under selective constraint. Our analysis identified three extended periods in the evolution of gene regulatory elements. Early vertebrate evolution was characterized by regulatory gains near transcription factors and developmental genes, but this trend was replaced by innovations near extracellular signaling genes, and then innovations near posttranslational protein modifiers.

[STRING]","MosaicFinder: Identification of fused gene families in sequence similarity networks (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23365410)
This leads to an efficient formulation of previous methods of fused gene identification, which we implemented in the Python program FusedTriplets. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23365410)
We implemented this method in the C++ program MosaicFinder, which additionally uses local alignments to discard false positive candidates and indicates potential fusion points. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23365410)
Inference of gene function based on gene fusion events: the rosetta-stone method. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18025684)
The basic idea is based on the principle of ""guilt by association."" It is assumed that two proteins, which are found to be transcribed by a single transcript in one (or several) genomes are likely to be functionally linked, for example by acting in a same metabolic pathway or by forming a multiprotein complex. This method is of particular interest for studying genes that exhibit no, or only remote, homologies with already well-characterized proteins (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18025684)
This chapter uses the FusionDB database (http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/FusionDB/) as source of information. FusionDB provides a characterization of a large number of gene fusion events at hand of multiple sequence alignments. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18025684)
PLEX can be searched iteratively and also enables searches for chromosomal gene neighbors and Rosetta Stone linkages. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15701682)
While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15215406)
Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. The database STRING is a precomputed global resource for the exploration and analysis of these associations. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12519996)
Protein interaction maps for complete genomes based on gene fusion events (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10573422)
Here we present a method that identifies gene-fusion events in complete genomes, solely based on sequence comparison. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10573422)
Gene fusions have been suggested to be useful characters for identifying evolutionary relationships because they constitute synapomorphies or cladistic characters. To investigate the fidelity of gene-fusion characters, we developed an approach for identifying differentially distributed gene fusions among whole-genome datasets: fdfBLAST.

Here we present Predictome, a database of predicted links between the proteins of 44 genomes based on the implementation of three computational methods--chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic profiling and domain fusion (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11752322)
Pairs of genes that function together in a pathway or cellular system can sometimes be found fused together in another organism as a Rosetta Stone protein--a fusion protein whose separate domains are homologous to the two functionally-related proteins. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15130848)
Using the Rosetta Stone method and this scoring scheme, we find all significant functional linkages for proteins of E. coli, P. horikshii and S. cerevisiae, and measure the extent of the resulting protein networks. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15130848)"
Which is the definition of pyknons in DNA?,N/A,"Among the millions of discovered patterns, we found a subset of 127,998 patterns, termed pyknons, which have additional nonoverlapping instances in the untranslated and protein-coding regions of 30,675 transcripts from 20,059 human genes. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16636294)
a nonrandom pattern of repeated elements, called pyknons, which are found more frequently in the 3' untranslated regions of genes than in other regions of the human genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16751093)
We discuss the general implications of molecular epigenetics with special emphasis on drug abuse, bar-codes, pyknons, and miRNAs for translational and clinical research (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19052667)
Here we report identification of ubiquitous template design sequences (templum intentio series, templints) of human genomes common for disease-associated SNPs, microRNAs and pyknons (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19229130)
We demonstrate that genome-unique SNP-coding sequences associated with multiple common human disorders appear assembled from series of ubiquitous short octamer sequences shared by 5'-UTR pyknons and microRNAs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19229130)
Allele-specific sequence variations link disease-associated SNPs to distinct sets of pyknons and microRNAs, suggesting that increased susceptibility to multiple common human disorders is associated with global alterations of genome-wide regulatory templates affecting the biogenesis and functions of non-coding RNAs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19229130)
yknons are non-random sequence patterns significantly repeated throughout non-coding genomic DNA that also appear at least once among coding genes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19452047)
Pyknons have only been discovered in the human genome, so it is unknown whether pyknons have wider biological relevance or are simply a phenomenon of the human genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19452047)
A. thaliana pyknons exhibit features similar to human pyknons, including being distinct sequence patterns, having multiple instances in genes and having remarkable similarity to small RNA sequences with roles in gene silencing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19452047)
Chromosomal position mapping revealed that genomic pyknon density has concordance with siRNA and transposable element positioning density (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19452047)
Because the A. thaliana and human genomes have approximately the same number of genes but drastically different amounts of non-coding DNA, these data reveal that pyknons represent a biologically important link between coding and non-coding DNA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19452047)
Because of the association of pyknons with siRNAs and localization to silenced regions of heterochromatin, we postulate that RNA-mediated gene silencing leads to the accumulation of gene sequences in non-coding DNA regions (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19452047)
 The new GSCKs are produced by evolutionary consolidation of retro-transcripts into pyknons that collect and evolve at the end of the pericentromeric heterochromatin and are eventually incorporated into the MDP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833446)"

The human AbetaH-J-J locus is a genomic sequence which generates three functionally distinct proteins, the enzyme aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase (AbetaH), the structural protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum junctin, and the membrane-bound calcium binding protein junctate. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17341613)
Aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase (AAH) hydroxylates Asp and Asn residues within EGF-like domains of Notch and Jagged, which mediate cell motility and differentiation. This study examines the expression, regulation and function of AAH, and its related transcripts, Humbug and Junctin, which lack catalytic domains, using SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells.

Screening a cDNA library from human skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle with a cDNA probe derived from junctin led to the isolation of two groups of cDNA clones. The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH(2)-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, a member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. We named the latter amino acid sequence junctate. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11007777)
Our study shows that alternative splicing of the same gene generates the following functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme (aspartyl beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of SR (junctin), and a membrane-bound calcium binding protein (junctate). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11007777)
Junctin is a calsequestrin binding protein detected in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles. In the present study, the human cardiac junctin cDNA has been cloned by human heart cDNA library screening and RT-PCR, and the cDNA sequence has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of human junctin (210 aa) has 84% sequence identity to that of canine junctin identified previously. A human junctin isoform (isoform 1, 225 aa) was also identified and characterized. The isoform 1 has a 15 aa insertion at the amino acid residue 55 of the human junctin. Northern blot analysis revealed that the human junctin was present both in cardiac and skeletal muscles, and the sizes of the transcripts were approximately 3.0 and 4.2kb. Amino acid residues 6-78 of human junctin and 35-107 of human aspartyl beta-hydroxylase (hAspH) overlapped perfectly. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10974562)
The mouse aspartyl beta-hydroxylase gene (Asph, BAH) has been cloned and characterized. The mouse BAH gene spans 200 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and contains 24 exons. Of three major BAH-related transcripts, the two largest (6,629 and 4,419 base pairs) encode full-length protein and differ only in the use of alternative polyadenylation signals.

A crucial part in the gene structure prediction is to determine the splice sites in the coding region. Identification of splice sites depends on the precise recognition of the boundaries between exons and introns of a given DNA sequence. This problem can be formulated as a classification of sequence elements into 'exon-intron' (EI), 'intron-exon' (IE) or 'None' (N) boundary classes. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21056007)

[MMDiff]
[cosmo]
[dPattern]
[TFBS]","Clustered occurrence of multiple TFs at genomic sites may arise from chromatin accessibility and local cooperation between TFs, or binding sites may simply appear clustered if the profiles are generated from diverse cell populations. Overlaps in TF binding profiles may also result from measurements taken at closely related time intervals. It is thus of great interest to distinguish TFs that directly regulate gene expression from those that are indirectly associated with gene expression. Graphical models, in particular Bayesian networks, provide a powerful mathematical framework to infer different types of dependencies. However, existing methods do not perform well when the features (here: TF binding profiles) are highly correlated, when their association with the biological outcome is weak, and when the sample size is small. Here, we develop a novel computational method, the Neighbourhood Consistent PC (NCPC) algorithms, which deal with these scenarios much more effectively than existing methods do. We further present a novel graphical representation, the Direct Dependence Graph (DDGraph), to better display the complex interactions among variables. NCPC and DDGraph can also be applied to other problems involving highly correlated biological features.

Is the gene DUX4 epigenetically regulated in somatic cells?,[yes],"There are several genes on chromosome 4q35 region including DUX4 within D4Z4 repeats. Transcription of these genes is usually repressed by epigenetic modifications of this chromosomal region and also accumulation of transcriptional repressors to the repeat array. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196547)
Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21288772)
The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24278031)

 These mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation.

DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21734574)
In contrast to control skeletal muscle and most other somatic tissues, full-length DUX4 transcript and protein is expressed at relatively abundant levels in human testis, most likely in the germ-line cells. Induced pluripotent (iPS) cells also express full-length DUX4 and differentiation of control iPS cells to embryoid bodies suppresses expression of full-length DUX4, whereas expression of full-length DUX4 persists in differentiated FSHD iPS cells. Together, these findings indicate that full-length DUX4 is normally expressed at specific developmental stages and is suppressed in most somatic tissues. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21060811)

DUX4 expresses a transcription factor that plays a major role in the development of FSHD through the initiation of a large gene dysregulation cascade that causes myogenic differentiation defects, atrophy and reduced response to oxidative stress.

[polC]","PolC co-evolves with RNA degradation enzymes that are present only in the A+T-rich Firmicutes clade (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22333191)
Bacterial genomes displaying a strong bias between the leading and the lagging strand of DNA replication encode two DNA polymerases III, DnaE and PolC, rather than a single one. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22333191)
SGD, PAS, and polC are all features associated with a group of low-GC, gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532183)
PAS is a characteristic of organisms with a heterodimeric DNA polymerase III alpha-subunit constituted by polC and dnaE (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532183)
Bacterial DNA polymerase III, the primary complex of DNA replication, consists of PolC and DnaE. PolC is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in the Firmicutes with low GC content, whereas DnaE is widely conserved in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24062730)

Is indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease?,[no],"We and others have published observational epidemiologic studies in support of vitamins in the primary prevention of CVD, but the results from intervention studies are mixed. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18377792)
For vitamin E, observational data suggest benefit at doses of 100 to 400 IU/d. Results from recent large-scale trials are mixed, with some showing modest benefit but others suggesting no benefit, especially for secondary prevention. Results for B vitamins are also mixed and further complicated by the recent folate fortification of the flour supply. If greater B vitamin intake does reduce CVD, the benefits are likely to be greatest for primary prevention and in populations with intake below dietary reference standards.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18377792)
In the dose-response meta-analysis, each 30 mg/day increase in vitamin C, 30 IU/day increase in vitamin E, and 1 mg/day increase in beta-carotene yielded the estimated overall relative risk for CHD of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.02), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99), and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.88-1.14), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in this meta-analysis suggest that an increase in dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins has encouraging prospects for possible CHD prevention.

The American Heart Association has recommended consumption of a balanced diet with emphasis on antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables but has made no recommendations regarding vitamin E supplementation for the general population. Although vitamin E supplementation seems to be safe for most people, recommendations from health care professionals should reflect the uncertainty of established benefit as demonstrated in clinical trials (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11702901)
Recent studies show that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins E and C have benefits in CHD prevention; however, supplementation with beta-carotene may have deleterious effects and is not recommended. Current evidence suggests that patients with CHD would probably benefit from taking vitamin E in a dosage of 400 IU per day and vitamin C in a dosage of 500 to 1,000 mg per day. Clinicians may also want to consider vitamin supplementation for CHD prevention in high-risk patients. Folate lowers elevated homocysteine levels, but evidence for routine supplemental use does not yet exist.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10498115)

Bacteria have developed several defense mechanisms against bacteriophages over evolutionary time, but the concept of prokaryotic RNA interference mediated defense mechanism against phages and other invading genetic elements has emerged only recently. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) together with closely associated genes (cas genes) constitute the CASS system that is believed to provide a RNAi-like defense mechanism against bacteriophages within the host bacterium.

What is known about MER41 repeat sequences?,N/A,"We report eleven new families of MEdium Reiteration frequency (MER) interspersed repeats in the genomes of Primates, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha. Two families of the human repeats, MER 46 and MER 47, represent non-autonomous DNA transposons. These sequences are flanked by TA target site duplications and have terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) similar to TIRs of DNA transposons. The sequences of five other families of repeats, MER41, MER48, MER50, MER51, and RMER3, resemble long terminal repeats of retroviruses. A potential involvement of some of the reported MER repeats in the regulation of transcription and genetic rearrangements is suggested. Age estimations place the origin of most MER repeats at the time of decline in MIR (Mammalian-wide Interspersed Repeats) retroposition and before the origin of the Alu family (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9204548)
MER41 repeat sequences contain inducible STAT1 binding sites (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20625510)
Contrary to previous claims, we find no evidence that STAT1 binds to multiple distinct motifs upon interferon-gamma stimulation in vivo. While a large majority of genomic sites with high ChIP-seq signal is associated with a nucleotide sequence resembling a STAT1 binding site, only a very small subset of the over 5 million potential STAT1 binding sites in the human genome is covered by ChIP-seq data. Furthermore a surprisingly large fraction of the ChIP-seq signal (5%) is absorbed by a small family of repetitive sequences (MER41). The observation of the binding of activated STAT1 protein to a specific repetitive element bolsters similar reports concerning p53 and other TFs, and strengthens the notion of an involvement of repeats in gene regulation. Incidentally MER41 are specific to primates, consequently, regulatory mechanisms in the IFN-STAT pathway might fundamentally differ between primates and rodents. On a methodological aspect, the presence of large numbers of nearly identical binding sites in repetitive sequences may lead to wrong conclusions about intrinsic binding preferences of TF as illustrated by the spacing analysis STAT1 tandem motifs. Therefore, ChIP-seq data should be analyzed independently within repetitive and non-repetitive sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20625510)
MER41 repeat sequences contain inducible STAT1 binding sites. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20625510)
The sequences of five other families of repeats, MER41, MER48, MER50, MER51, and RMER3, resemble long terminal repeats of retroviruses. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9204548)
Furthermore a surprisingly large fraction of the ChIP-seq signal (5%) is absorbed by a small family of repetitive sequences (MER41). (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20625510)
