What is the association between GERD and gluten ?
0) GER is the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus and is referred to as GER disease GERD when GER causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications
1) The notion that GERD and EoE can be distinguished by the response to proton pump inhibitor PPI treatment is based on the mistaken assumption that gastric acid suppression is the only important therapeutic effect of PPIs and therefore only GERD can respond to PPIs
2) GERD gastro esophageal reflux disease is defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications
3) Recent information indicates NERD can be further subclassified based on the results of pH studies and suggests that functional heartburn needs to be differentiated as that subgroup of patients in which there appears to be no relationship between symptoms however typical of GERD and acid exposure
4) The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of GERD in patients with COPD and association between GERD and COPD exacerbation
5) The aims of this study were to evaluate the epidemiologic and clinicopathologic characteristics among the subgroups of GERD i.e. non-erosive GERD NERD erosive GERD ERD and Barrett 's esophagus BE and the role of Helicobacter pylori H
6) To GERD or not to GERD this is the question
7) In this article we review the pathophysiology of GERD its effect on the immune system the effect of acid-blocking medications on allergic responses as well as several common atopic conditions that have been associated with GERD including asthma chronic rhinosinusitis CRS allergic rhinitis AR atopic dermatitis AD contact dermatitis CD food allergies proton pump inhibitor PPI responsive esophageal eosinophilia PPI-REE and eosinophilic esophagitis EoE
8) Non-erosive reflux disease NERD has emerged as a real entity in the spectrum of gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD and may indeed represent the most common manifestation of reflux disease
9) Gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD is one of the most common causes of chronic cough and a potential risk factor for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD

Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria ?
0) Using single and multiple mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( budding yeast ) that impede the interaction of DNA polymerase delta and the 5 ' - flap endonuclease Rad27/Fen1 with the PCNA sliding clamp , we show that the lack of coordination between these components during long-patch base excision repair of alkylation damage can result in many double-strand breaks within the chromosomes of nondividing haploid cells .
1) The primary purpose of HR , in mitotic cells , is to repair double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) generated endogenously by aberrant DNA replication and oxidative lesions , or by exposure to ionizing radiation ( IR ) , and other exogenous DNA damaging agents .
2) It is crucial that HR be carefully orchestrated because spurious events can create cytotoxic intermediates or cause genomic rearrangements and loss of gene heterozygosity , which can lead to cell death or contribute to the development of cancer .
3) Homologous recombination ( HR ) is a major mechanism for eliminating DNA double-strand breaks from chromosomes .
4) These factors favor non-B DNA structures that permit formation of transient single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) , making the DNA more vulnerable to agents such as the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID ) and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
5) An early step for HR pathways is formation of a heteroduplex , in which a single-strand from the broken DNA molecule pairs with a strand derived from an intact DNA molecule .
6) Following characterization of INBDSs , we tested the ability of HMGB1 to bind to the bent ( b1 , b2 , b4a , b4b , b5 , b6 , b7 , and b8 ) and non-bent DNA fragments ( nb7 , nb11 , nb1 , nb2 , nb4 , and nb5 ) via electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
7) DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are repaired by two main pathways : nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination ( HR ) .
8) DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are potentially lethal lesions repaired by two major pathways : homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) .
9) In agreement with an earlier study , deletions occurred at a much higher rate when ( TG ) 2 was on the nascent leading strand .

Is there any link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates ?
0) Our results show that all but one element are conserved in non-syntenic regions between vertebrate and tunicate genomes while being syntenic among vertebrates
1) Discovery of a large number of conserved non-coding elements CNEs in vertebrate genomes provides a cornerstone to elucidate molecular mechanisms of macroevolution
2) Although few noncoding elements are highly conserved between Drosophila and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae we find that A
3) Here we show that a class of conserved primarily non-coding regions in tetrapods originated from a previously unknown short interspersed repetitive element SINE retroposon family that was active in the Sarcopterygii lobe-finned fishes and terrestrial vertebrates in the Silurian period at least 410 million years ago ref
4) In vertebrates conserved noncoding elements CNEs are functionally constrained sequences that can show striking conservation over 400 million years of evolutionary distance and frequently are located megabases away from target developmental genes
5) We found 113,070 noncoding elements conserved between the two species amounting to 3.3 of the genome
6) These elements are different from other conserved noncoding elements and appear to be important regulatory innovations that became fixed following the emergence of vertebrates from the sea to the land
7) Our results indicate that conserved non-coding elements CNEs consist of blocks with distinct evolutionary history each having been frozen since different evolutionary era along the vertebrate lineage
8) Highly conserved elements discovered in vertebrates are present in non-syntenic loci of tunicates act as enhancers and can be transcribed during development
9) Studies on the zebrafish phox2b gene region and the ENCODE project suggest that many regulatory elements are not highly conserved posing intriguing questions about the relationship between noncoding sequence conservation and function and the evolution of regulatory sequences

2) REG1 , currently undergoing phase 2B clinical investigation , consists of an RNA aptamer ( RB006 ; pegnivacogin ) which targets factor IXa and its complementary controlling agent ( RB007 ; anivamersen ) .
3) Moreover , antibodies can act as guides in the quest for small molecules that have the ability to modulate protein-protein interactions , which have traditionally only been considered to be tractable targets for biological drugs .
4) Use of peptides that can directly target cancer cells without affecting normal cells ( targeted therapy ) is evolving as an alternate strategy to conventional chemotherapy .
5) In the last few years , peptide drugs have become attractive agents in cancer therapy .
6) Several approaches have been used : monoclonal antibodies targeting a ligand ( eg , bevacizumab , anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ) , monoclonal antibodies targeting a receptor ( eg , cetuximab , anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ) , vaccines targeting a ligand ( eg , G17DT , anti-gastrin ) , or a cell surface antigen ( eg , carcinoembryonic antigen-TRIad of COstimulatory Molecules , anti-CEA ) .
7) Other targeted therapies , such as bevacizumab , a monoclonal antibody targeting angiogenesis , lapatinib , a dual human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) -1 and HER-2 inhibitor , other small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors , and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors , have been developed in phase II and III clinical trials .
8) Combining immunotherapy with conventional therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy or combining an anticancer peptide with a nonpeptidic cytotoxic drug is an example of this emerging field .
9) While a large number of studies has been published , the emphasis here is placed on the carbonic anhydrase IX ( CA-IX ) and the conjugated liposomes that are likely to open a new chapter on drug delivery system by using immunoliposomes to deliver anticancer ingredients to cancer cells in vivo .

Which protein is affected by dusp8 activation ?
0) Na ( + ) / K ( + ) pump or sodium - and potassium-activated adenosine 5 ' - triphosphatase ( Na ( + ) , K ( + ) - ATPase ) , its enzymatic version , is a crucial protein responsible for the electrochemical gradient across the cell membranes .
1) One example of such effects includes the activity of interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β ) ; this inflammatory mediator , upon binding to IL-1R1 neuronal membrane receptors will rapidly induce protein kinases in damage-sensing neurons , consequently altering heat-activated ionic inward currents leading to increased neuronal sensitivity to harmful heat .
2) When the body is infected by microorganism , the immune inflammatory reaction will be regulated through a series of signal transduction mechanism , and Rho GTPases signal transduction mechanism is one of the important signal pathways .
3) Employing signal transduction pathways that can modulate both excitatory and inhibitory responses , the mGluR system drives a spectrum of cellular pathways that involve protein kinases , endonucleases , cellular acidity , energy metabolism , mitochondrial membrane potential , caspases , and specific mitogen-activated protein kinases .

6) The protease-activated receptors ( PARs ) pathway can be considered the central hub of this regulatory network , mainly through thrombin or activated protein C ( aPC ) .
7) Although the precise mechanisms that result in the degeneration of neurons and the relevant pathological changes remain unclear , the crucial role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is associated with several proteins ( such as α-synuclein , DJ-1 , Amyloid β and tau protein ) and some signaling pathways ( such as extracellular regulated protein kinases , phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B pathway and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ) that are tightly associated with the neural damage .
8) G proteins are an important family of signalling molecules controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange and GTPase activity in what is commonly called an ' activation/inactivation cycle ' .
9) Hypoxia , nutrient deprivation , perturbation of redox status and aberrant calcium regulation can all trigger the ER stress response , which is mediated through three main sensors , namely inositol requiring element-1 ( IRE-1 ) , protein kinase-like ER kinase ( PERK ) and activating transcription factor 6 ( ATF6 ) .

Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria ?
0) The xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group proteins ( XPs ) , which include XPA through XPG , play a critical role in coordinating and promoting global genome and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( GG-NER and TC-NER , respectively ) pathways in eukaryotic cells .
1) Recent data suggest that the key transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair factor ( TC-NER ) Cockayne syndrome group B ( CSB ) and the global genome NER-initiating factor XPC are implicated in the protection of cells against oxidative DNA damages .
2) Because severe diseases , such as Cockayne syndrome , are associated with defects or mutations in proteins required for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair , complete understanding of this pathway should allow us to understand this disease better and eventually to propose adequate therapies .
3) In both bacteria and eukarya , lesions located in transcribed strands are repaired significantly faster than those located in non-transcribed strands due to damage signalling by stalled RNA polymerase molecules : a phenomenon known as transcription-coupled repair ( TCR ) .
4) DSBs are potentially lethal and so eukaryotic cells have evolved an elaborate pathway , the DNA damage response , which detects the damage , recruits proteins to the DSBs , activates checkpoints to stall cell cycle progression and ultimately mediates repair of the damaged DNA .
5) Eukaryotic transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TC-NER ) is a pathway that removes DNA lesions capable of blocking RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) transcription from the template strand .
6) Recent data suggest that CSA and CSB play differential roles in mammalian TC-NER : CSB as a repair coupling factor to attract NER proteins , chromatin remodellers and the CSA - E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to the stalled RNAPIIo .
7) The molecular mechanisms by which these proteins bring about efficient TC-NER and trigger signaling after transcription arrest remain elusive ; particularly the role of chromatin remodeling in TC-NER needs to be clarified in the context of anticipated structural changes that allow repair and transcription restart .
8) Many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease are associated with the aggregation of defective , misfolded proteins , and several mechanisms exist to prevent such aggregation , both through direct protein repair and through the elimination and repair of faulty or damaged RNAs .
9) Although enormous progress has been made over recent years in identifying and characterizing FA factors as well as in elucidating certain aspects of the biology of FA , the mechanistic details of the ICL repair defects in FA patients remain unknown .

What types of DNA mutations are induced by 2-hydroxy-dATP ( 2-OH-dATP ) ?
0) The mutation induced by 2-OH-dATP but not that induced by 8-OH-dGTP occurred less frequently in the dinB strain than in the wild-type wt strain suggesting the involvement of pol IV in the mutagenesis by 2-OH-dATP
1) These results constitute the first direct evidence to show that 8-OH-dGTP actually induces mutations in living mammalian cells
2) To reveal the roles of Y family DNA polymerases in the mutagenesis induced by oxidatively damaged DNA precursors 2-hydroxy-dATP 2-OH-dATP and 8-hydroxy-dGTP 8-OH-dGTP were introduced into Escherichia coli strains deficient in the Y family polymerases DNA polymerase IV pol IV encoded by the dinB gene and DNA polymerase V pol V encoded by the umuDC locus
3) These results suggest that h Poleta incorporates 2-OH-dATP opposite template G and incorporates 8-OH-dGTP opposite template A and slightly opposite template C during DNA synthesis
4) It is critically important in the prevention of DNA mutations derived from 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine 8-oxoG which are the major lesions resulting from guanine oxidation
5) In DNA 8-oxo-7 ,8 dihydroguanine G O 8-hydroxyguanine is one of the most pivotal oxidatively damaged bases and induces G C T A transversion mutations
6) To assess the functions of the three human MutT-type enzymes MTH1 MTH2 and NUDT5 mutation induction by an oxidized form of dGTP 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine 5 triphosphate 8-OH-dGTP 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2 deoxyguanosine 5 triphosphate was examined using human 293T cells treated with their specific siRNAs

1) Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation H3K4me3 and histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation H3K9me3 are epigenetic marks with opposing roles in transcription regulation
2) Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation H3K4me3 is a major hallmark of promoter-proximal histones at transcribed genes
3) While histone H3K4 trimethylation H3K4me3 is thought to promote nucleosome acetylation and remodeling near promoters we show here that H3K4 dimethylation H3K4me2 by Set1 leads to reduced histone acetylation levels near 5 ends of genes
4) Using a series of histone peptides we now show that the recognition of mono and dimethylated lysines in histones H3 H4 and H1 .4 but not their trimethylated or unmodified counterparts by 3xMBT occurs in the context of a basic environment requiring a conserved aspartic acid D355 in the second MBT repeat
5) Typically sRNAs originating from long noncoding RNAs guide Argonaute-containing effector complexes to complementary nascent RNAs to initiate histone H3 lysine 9 di and trimethylation H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 respectively and the formation of heterochromatin
6) Mono di or trimethylation of lysine residues by histone lysine methyltransferases HKMTases can have activating or repressive functions depending on the position and context of the modified lysine
7) In Arabidopsis trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 H3K9me3 is mainly associated with euchromatin and transcribed genes although low levels of this mark are also detected at transposons and repeat sequences

Which cellular processes are regulated by Nanog ?
0) Here we describe that the regulation of Oct4 by Aurora kinase b Aurkb protein phosphatase 1 PP1 axis during the cell cycle is important for resetting Oct4 to pluripotency and cell cycle related target genes in determining the identity of ESCs
1) Elucidating how dynamic Nanog levels are regulated in pluripotent cells and modulate their potential is therefore critical to develop a better understanding of the pluripotent state
2) Embryonic stem ES cell self-renewal is regulated by transcription factors including Oct4 Sox2 and Nanog
3) The expression of Zic3 in pluripotent ES cells is also directly regulated by Oct4 Sox2 and Nanog
4) Understanding how Nanog is transcriptionally regulated is important for further dissecting mechanisms of ESC pluripotency and somatic cell reprogramming
5) To elucidate the physiological roles of Nanog in tumorigenesis we developed an inducible Nanog transgenic mouse model in which the expression of Nanog in adult tissues can be induced via LoxP/Cre-mediated deletion
6) Taken together these results indicate that SUMOylation has a negative effect on Nanog expression and provides new insights into the mechanism of SUMO modification involved in ES cells regulation
7) Understanding molecular mechanisms by which Nanog functions should illuminate fundamental properties of stem cells and the process of cellular reprogramming
8) Nanog regulates molecules involved in stemness and cell cycle-signaling pathway for maintenance of pluripotency of P19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells
9) Together with previous reports that Nanog may regulate Esrrb gene expression our results suggest that Esrrb and Nanog act as part of a feedback regulatory circuit that modulates the fluctuating self-renewal capacity of ES cell populations

--------------------
Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of facultative heterochromatin ?
0) This histone modification is a feature of facultative heterochromatin in many eukaryotes and maintains transcriptional repression established during early development
1) How heterochromatic histone modifications and silencing factors contribute to the special primary and higher order structures of heterochromatin has begun to be understood
2) Multiple features of heterochromatin-including the presence or absence of specific histone modifications DNA methylation and small RNAs-have been implicated in distinguishing heterochromatin from euchromatin in various organisms
3) The past two decades have seen dramatic advances in dissecting the molecular aspects of heterochromatin because of the identification of the histone code for heterochromatin as well as its writers and erasers histone-modifying enzymes and readers silencing factors recognizing histone modifications
4) While certain active promoters can block propagation of heterochromatin there are also specialized DNA elements referred to as chromatin barriers that serve to demarcate the boundary of facultative heterochromatin formation
5) Here we show that two meiotic gene loci in fission yeast mei4 and ssm4 comprise facultative heterochromatin that is regulated in a developmental stage-dependent manner
6) Formation of facultative heterochromatin at specific genomic loci is fundamentally important in defining cellular properties such as differentiation potential and responsiveness to developmental physiological and environmental stimuli
7) We tested the role of three proteins thought to be important for establishment of heterochromatin namely the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase DIM-5 Heterochromatin Protein 1 HP1 which specifically binds to the product of DIM-5 trimethylated H3 lysine 9 H3K9me3 and DIM-3 importin alpha which is involved in DIM-5 localization
8) Here we focus on heterochromatin assembly in Drosophila melanogaster the model organism in which variegation or cell-to-cell variable gene expression resulting from heterochromatin formation was first described
9) Here we describe facultative heterochromatin islands in fission yeast and show that their formation at meiotic genes requires factors that eliminate meiotic messenger RNAs mRNAs during vegetative growth
--------------------
Which cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor is regulated by Bmi-1 ?
0) One important pathway regulated by Bmi-1 is that involving two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16 Ink4a and p19 Arf as Bmi-1 represses the INK4a locus on which they are encoded
1) Here we report that the polo-like kinase 1 PLK1 regulates BMI1 expression and that its inhibition can efficiently down-regulate BMI1 expression and PRC1 activity and induce premature senescence in breast cancer cells
2) It has been suggested that the B-cell specific moloney leukemia virus insertion site 1 Bmi-1 gene plays an oncogenic role in several types of human cancer but the status of Bmi-1 amplification and expression in ovarian cancer and its clinical/prognostic significance are unclear
3) Using a stable and inducible shRNA system to silence Bmi-1 gene expression we show a novel role for Bmi-1 in regulating the growth and clonogenic capacity of multiple myeloma cells both in vitro and in vivo
4) Thus our studies suggest that Mel-18 and Bmi-1 may regulate the Akt pathway in breast cancer cells and that Mel-18 functions as a tumor suppressor by repressing the expression of Bmi-1 and consequently down-regulating Akt activity
5) Acute myeloid leukemic cells lacking Bmi-1 undergo proliferation arrest and show signs of differentiation and apoptosis which leads to the proposal of Bmi-1 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in leukemia
6) Implication of polycomb members Bmi-1 Mel-18 and Hpc-2 in the regulation of p16INK4a p14ARF h-TERT and c-Myc expression in primary breast carcinomas
7) Altogether these results identify Sin3B as a novel direct target of Bmi-1 and establish Bmi-1-driven repression of Sin3B as an essential regulator of cellular senescence
8) B-cell specific moloney leukemia virus insertion site 1 Bmi-1 gene plays important roles in gastric cancer but the epigenetic regulatory mechanism by microRNA miRNA and the functional significance of Bmi-1 inhibition in gastric cancer remains elusive
9) Therefore these studies not only highlight Bmi-1 as a cancer-dependent factor in multiple myeloma but also elucidate a novel antiapoptotic mechanism for Bmi-1 function involving the suppression of Bim

--------------------
List proteins of lipids droplets
0) The rate and extent of lipid hydrolysis in the small intestine decreased as the vitamin content increased probably because the vitamin molecules inhibited the ability of lipase to reach the triacylglycerols inside the lipid droplets
1) To conclude our findings indicate that adsorption/association of salivary protein components onto the emulsion droplets is related to the type of emulsifying proteins at the oil-water interfaces and it is probably driven by the overall net charge at the droplet 's oil-water interfaces i.e. positive for lysozyme stabilized emulsions and negative for beta-lactoglobulin stabilized emulsion at neutral pH
2) These results suggest that proteins at the interface of emulsion droplets primarily stabilize lipid hydroperoxides by electrostatically inhibiting iron-hydroperoxide interactions
3) It is shown that contrary to native proteins protein particles adsorb at the interface and can form a monolayer that inhibits fusion of emulsion droplets
4) Emulsified lipid digestion was tailored by manipulating the physical state of dispersed oil droplets in whey protein stabilized oil-in-water O/W emulsions where the oil phase consisted of one of five ratios of soybean oil SO and fully hydrogenated soybean oil FHSO
5) The scaffolding network of the crosslinked protein bilayers on the droplets is so strong that both the water and the oil can be removed from the emulsions by freeze drying without collapse of the scaffold
6) The stickiness is due to the multipolar nature of the proteins in contrast to the bipolar nature of surfactants or other amphiphilic compounds that form emulsions with repulsive droplets
7) This study proposes a novel technique for drying lipid nanoemulsion suspensions to create so-called Trojan particles ie polymer microparticles around 2 μm which very homogeneously entrap the nano-oil droplets around 150 nm in their core
8) Enhancing physicochemical properties of emulsions by heteroaggregation of oppositely charged lactoferrin coated lutein droplets and whey protein isolate coated DHA droplets
9) Based on these results it is argued that the high macroscopic viscosity and lipid agglomeration of emulsions containing GMU is due to a lipid globule-protein-network where the lipid globules are connected via caseinate
--------------------
Is Calcium homeostasis important in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology ?
0) Calcium Ca 2 is an important intracellular messenger regulating myocyte contraction via excitation-contraction EC coupling and gene transcription underlying hypertrophy in the heart
1) The hallmark features of heart failure are mechanical dysfunction and arrhythmias defective intracellular Ca homeostasis is a central cause of contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias in failing myocardium
2) Calcium is an important participant in many physiologic processes including coagulation cell membrane transfer hormone release neuromuscular activation and myocardial contraction
3) Disrupted cardiomyocyte Ca 2 homeostasis is recognized as a major contributor to the heart failure phenotype as it plays a key role in systolic and diastolic dysfunction arrhythmogenesis and hypertrophy and apoptosis signaling
4) Abnormalities of autonomic regulation of potassium current play a role in the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias and alterations in acetylcholine-activated potassium channels may play a key role in atrial fibrillation
5) Hydrogen sulfide H2S has emerged as the third gasotransmitter following the nitric oxide and carbon monoxide in the body and plays an important role in both physiology and pathophysiology
6) Recent discoveries have led to gene-based therapies targeting calcium-transporting or binding proteins such as the cardiac sarco endo plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase SERCA2a leading to improvements in calcium homeostasis and excitation-contraction coupling
7) The need to better understand the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of calcium dysregulation contributing to neuronal loss following stroke/cerebral ischemia is essential for the development of new treatments in order to reduce ischemic brain injury
8) A complex array of mechanisms regulate intracellular free calcium levels in the heart and vasculature and a failure in these systems to maintain normal Ca 2 homeostasis has been linked to both heart failure and hypertension
9) Classic concepts about the role of epicardial adipose tissue EpAT in heart physiology include its role in cardiac metabolism mechanical protection of coronaries innervation and possibly cryoprotection of the heart too
--------------------
Do proton pump inhibitors affect thyroxine absorption ?
0) Factors that influence energy metabolism and substrate oxidation such as thyroid hormones THs may be important regulators of body weight
1) Preparing hyperthyroid patients for thyroid surgery with a combination of antithyroid drugs and thyroxine has long been controversial because this combination usually results in only partial inhibition of thyroid function
2) The aim of this study in pregnant women with hypothyroidism treated by levothyroxine is to examine the interrelations between thyroid-stimulating hormone TSH free thyroxine FT 4 and free tri-iodothyronine FT 3 and examine whether in such patients the treatment is adequate
3) To evaluate the effects of levothyroxine L-T4 replacement on lipoprotein profile in patients with mild subclinical hypothyroidism defined as a serum TSH level between 5 to 10 mU/l with a normal serum free thyroxine level
4) Several thyroid hormone preparations are currently available including levothyroxine sodium thyroxine liothyronine triiodothyronine and desiccated thyroid extract as well as a combination of levothyroxine sodium and liothyronine
5) Evidence is mounting that levothyroxine monotherapy can not assure a euthyroid state in all tissues simultaneously and that normal serum TSH levels in patients receiving levothyroxine reflect pituitary euthyroidism alone
6) It has been hypothesized that metformin may suppress serum thyrotropin TSH concentrations by enhancing LT4 absorption or by directly affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
7) To evaluate the association between mercury exposure and thyroid-stimulating hormone TSH total triiodothyronine TT3 and free thyroxine FT4 levels during pregnancy as well as to explore if there is any synergic action between mercury and intake of iodine from different sources
8) A normal thyrotropin TSH level of 1-2 mU/L is considered the determinant of optimal daily levothyroxine sodium dose in patients with primary hypothyroidism whereas normal thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels in the mid or upper normal range may denote optimal replacement in patients with central hypothyroidism
9) While calcium carbonate is known to interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levothyroxine we hypothesized that other phosphate binders would also bind to levothyroxine and decrease bioavailability of levothyroxine in dialysis patients
--------------------
Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome ?
0) Brugada syndrome BrS is an arrhythmogenic disorder that has been linked to mutations in SCN5A the gene encoding for the pore-forming α-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel
1) Loss-of-function mutations in SCN5A which encodes the predominant cardiac sodium channel alpha subunit NaV1 .5 can cause Brugada syndrome and cardiac conduction disease
2) Mutations in the SCN1A gene-encoding voltage-gated sodium channel α-I subunit Nav1 .1 cause various spectrum of epilepsies including Dravet syndrome DS a severe and intractable form
3) Mutations in SCN5A the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel Na v 1.5 have been associated with various inherited arrhythmia syndromes including Brugada syndrome BrS
4) The hereditary long QT syndrome is characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization that can be caused by mutations to the KCNQ1 gene which encodes the α subunits of the cardiac potassium channel complex that carries the I Ks current the β subunits are encoded by KCNE1
5) Mutations of SCN1A encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha1 subunit represent the most frequent genetic cause of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy SMEI
6) Mutations in the gene encoding the gamma2 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor GABRG2 have been reported to cause childhood absence epilepsy CAE febrile seizures FS and generalized epilepsy with FS plus GEFS
7) We searched for disease-causing mutations in the genes of the alpha1 alpha5 gamma2 and delta subunits of the GABA-A receptor that were previously shown to contain epilepsy-causing mutations or epilepsy susceptibility polymorphisms
8) Transcription factor AP-2 beta TFAP2B mutations are associated with the Char syndrome a disorder associated with PDA and with facial and fingers abnormalities
9) Congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A is caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene that encodes the laminin α2 chain a component of the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix protein laminin-211
--------------------
The antibodies MK-3475 and CT-011 have shown promising results in treating malignancies . Which protein are they targeting ?
0) Nivolumab and pembrolizumab ( formerly lambrolizumab ) , the two FDA-approved anti-programmed death-1 monoclonal antibodies , show highly durable response rates and long-term safety , validating the importance of the programmed cell death protein 1 pathway blockade for treatment of malignant melanoma .
1) ZCH-2B8a , an antibody targeting actin-binding protein coronin-1a , is a potential therapeutic agent for B-lineage malignancies .
2) The clinical success of monoclonal antibody immune checkpoint modulators such as ipilimumab , which targets cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ) , and the recently approved agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab , which target programmed cell death receptor 1 ( PD-1 ) , has stimulated renewed enthusiasm for anticancer immunotherapy , which was heralded by Science as ' Breakthrough of the Year ' in 2013 .
3) The recent application of Trastuzumab , an antibody to a receptor tyrosine kinase , in adjuvant breast cancer therapy marks the beginning of a new phase in cancer treatment .
4) The preclinical findings and clinical responses associated with programmed death-1 ( PD-1 ) and PD-ligand pathway blockade seem promising , making these targets highly sought for cancer immunotherapy .
5) Immunologic checkpoint blockade with antibodies against the programmed cell death protein-1 ( PD-1 ) or its ligand ( PD-L1 ) is an effective method for reversing cancer immunosuppression and thereby promoting immune responses against several cancer types .
6) Antibodies ( ipilimumab and tremelimumab ) targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 ( CTLA-4 ) , an inhibitory molecule on T cells , represent the vanguard of these new drugs .

--------------------
From which sequence does the Alu repeat originate from ?
0) Alu repeats which account for 10 of the human genome were originally considered to be junk DNA
1) Using the Alu sequence from the prooncogen bcl2 intron and the consensus AluSx sequence as representative examples we determined characteristic Alu sites that are capable of adopting G-quadruplex GQ conformations i.e. potential quadruplex sites PQSAlu and demonstrated by bioinformatics methods that those sites are Alu-specific in the human genome
2) Our results indicate that there exist common quasiperiods in most Alu repeats
3) The 3 end of an AluSx element flanked by target site duplications 5 ACTRCCAR-3 or 5 ACTRCCARTTA-3 followed the CCTG repeat suggesting that the repeat was originally derived from the Alu element insertion
4) Hypomethylation of DNA repetitive elements is a common finding in cancer but very little is known about the DNA methylation changes of different types of DNA repetitive elements such as interspersed repeats LINE1 and Alu Yb8 and tandem repeats Sat-alpha NBL-2 and D4Z4
5) Since a presence-absence variant may have been the result of a recent Alu or LINE insertion we analyzed 7 isolated IRS-morphs that were generated in part with a primer derived from either a consensus LINE or a young Alu subfamily specific sequence and observed by Southern blot analysis that these variants resulted from other types of genomic alterations
6) First a TTTCT motif arose from a TTTTT motif at the junction of Alu and LINE-1 which was followed by introduction of A to make an ATTCT motif in hominoids
7) Based on sequence analysis of the 800 Alu polymorphisms we report three new Alu subfamilies Ya3 Ya4b and Yb11 with Yb11 being the smallest known Alu subfamily
8) Pairs of inverted Alu repeats in RNA can form duplex structures that lead to hyperediting by the ADAR enzymes and at least 333 human genes contain such repeats in their 3 UTRs
9) By targeting the unmethylated SmaI site within the Alu sequence as a surrogate marker we have quantified and identified unmethylated Alu elements on the genomic scale
--------------------
How is mTORC1 involved in the regulation of heat stress ?
0) Insulin growth factors and a variety of cellular stressors regulate mTORC1 by controlling Rheb GTP charging through modulating the activity of the tuberous sclerosis complex the Rheb GTPase activating protein
1) How amino acid levels are communicated to mTORC1 is only recently coming to light by the discovery of a lysosome-based signaling system composed of Rags Ras-related GTPases and Ragulator v-ATPase GATOR GAP activity towards Rags and folliculin FLCN complexes
2) mTOR mechanistic target of rapamycin is a serine/threonine protein kinase that as part of mTORC1 mTOR complex 1 acts as an important molecular connection between nutrient signals and the metabolic processes indispensable for cell growth
3) Much is now understood about how the lysosome contributes to amino acid sensing by mTORC1 the involvement of the energy-sensing kinase AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK at the lysosome and how both AMPK and mTORC1 signalling pathways feedback to lysosomal biogenesis and regeneration following autophagy
4) Endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells a feed-back regulation by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 mTORC1
5) Although mTORC1 activation by positive signals such as growth factors and nutrients has been extensively investigated the mechanism of mTORC1 regulation by stress signals is less understood
6) Our recent work implicates the mTORC1 co-factor and PI3K-related Kinase PIKK stabilizer TELO2 in regulating mTORC1 activity in a MAPK-Interacting Kinase MNK responsive manner during mitogenic stimulation of cancer cells and T cell activation
7) The activity of mTORC1 is regulated by the integration of many signals including growth factors insulin nutrients energy availability and cellular stressors such as hypoxia osmotic stress reactive oxygen species and viral infection
8) The mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR interacts with raptor to form the protein complex mTORC1 mTOR complex 1 which plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth in response to environmental cues
9) Taken together our results suggest that the glycolytic flux regulates mTOR 's access to Rheb by regulating the Rheb-GAPDH interaction thereby allowing mTORC1 to coordinate cell growth with glucose availability
--------------------
Which myosin isozymes are located within the pericuticular necklace of the hair cell ?
0) NMHC-IIa a nonmuscle myosin heavy chain isoform encoded by MYH9 is expressed in sensory hair cells and its dysfunction is associated with syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing loss
1) Because this specialized form of polarized cell growth requires both a dynamic actin cytoskeleton and active secretion it has been proposed that the F-actin-associated motor myosin XI is essential for this process
2) Myosin activation is regulated by phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain MRLC encoded by spaghettisquash or sqh in Drosophila first on Ser21 and subsequently on Thr20
3) Anemone hair bundles are located on the tentacles where they detect the swimming movements of nearby prey
4) We found that hair cells express two isoforms of myosin 15 that differ by inclusion of an 133-kDa N-terminal domain and that these isoforms can selectively traffic to different stereocilia rows
5) Defects in myosin VIIa the PDZ-domain-containing protein harmonin cadherin 23 and protocadherin 15 two cadherins with large extracellular regions and the putative scaffolding protein Sans underlie five genetic forms of Usher syndrome type I USH1 the most frequent cause of hereditary deafness-blindness in humans
6) Mutations in genes encoding myosin VIIa harmonin cadherin 23 protocadherin 15 or sans cause Usher syndrome type I USH1 characterized by congenital deafness vestibular dysfunction and retinitis pigmentosa leading to blindness in humans and hair bundle disorganization in mice
7) In this article we show that the USH2A protein also known as usherin is an exceptionally large approximately 600-kDa matrix protein expressed specifically in retinal photoreceptors and developing cochlear hair cells
8) Vertebrate smooth-muscle myosin is activated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain whereas scallop striated adductor-muscle myosin is activated by direct calcium binding to its essential light chain
9) It thus appears that coleoid cephalopods including the cuttlefish and octopus may use ultrastructural modifications rather than tissue-specific myosin isoforms to adjust contractile velocities
--------------------
Are nucleosomes positioned at DNA replication origins ?
0) Nucleosomes are often packed into evenly spaced arrays that are reproducibly positioned but how such organization is established and maintained through dramatic events such as DNA replication is poorly understood
1) Nucleosome positioning is influenced by DNA sequence chromatin remodelers and non-histone chromatin factors and genomic maps of nucleosomes are now being constructed
2) Furuyama and Henikoff 2009 now provide surprising evidence that centromeric nucleosomes wrap DNA in an orientation that is opposite to that of canonical nucleosomes
3) Because histones bind DNA very tightly the location on DNA and the level of occupancy of a given DNA sequence by nucleosomes can profoundly affect accessibility of non-histone proteins to chromatin affecting virtually all DNA-dependent processes such as transcription DNA repair DNA replication and recombination
4) By unzipping individual DNA duplexes each containing a uniquely positioned nucleosome flanked by long segments of DNA we directly probed histone-DNA interactions
5) Prenucleosomes are formed rapidly upon the deposition of histones onto DNA and can be converted into canonical nucleosomes by an ATP-driven chromatin assembly factor such as ACF
6) As nucleosomes largely impede access to DNA and thereby provide an important level of genome regulation it is of general interest to understand the mechanisms generating nucleosome positioning and especially the stereotypical NDR-array pattern
7) Here we analyze the genome-wide location of nucleosomes during zebrafish embryogenesis and show that well-positioned nucleosome arrays appear on thousands of promoters during the activation of the zygotic genome
8) By fusing the Chd1 remodeler to the DNA binding domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ume6 repressor we have engineered a fusion remodeler that selectively positions nucleosomes on top of adjacent Ume6 binding motifs in a highly predictable and reproducible manner
9) To identify nucleosomes with alternative structures genome-wide we used H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping which revealed that 5 of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleosome positions have asymmetric histone-DNA interactions
--------------------
Name five programs for transcript quantification from RNASeq experiments
0) High-throughput RNA sequencing RNA-seq has become a powerful technology for transcriptome-wide analysis of AS but RT-PCR still remains the gold-standard approach for quantifying and validating exon splicing levels
1) Understanding the current limitations of RNA-seq is crucial for reliable analysis and the lack of high quality comprehensive transcriptomes for most species including model organisms such as Arabidopsis is a major constraint in accurate quantification of transcript isoforms
2) The Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit AmpliSeq was recently introduced by Life Technologies as a whole-transcriptome targeted gene quantification kit to overcome these limitations of RNA-seq
3) With the growing popularity of RNA-seq for transcriptome studies we expect PrimerSeq to help bridge the gap between high-throughput RNA-seq discovery of AS events and molecular analysis of candidate events by RT-PCR
4) In the experiments on the RNA-Seq data in The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA the transcript abundances estimated by Net-RSTQ are more informative for patient sample classification of ovarian cancer breast cancer and lung cancer
5) Shot gun sequencing of RNAs or RNA-Seq as it is known is providing the means to simultaneously survey locus activity transcript-specific expression sequence content of transcripts and transcriptome discovery
6) The recent development of various deep sequencing techniques has led to the most powerful transcript profiling method available to date RNA sequencing or RNA-Seq
7) RNA-Seq experiments in which transcripts are converted to cDNA and sequenced allow the resolution and quantification of alternative transcript isoforms
8) In differential expression analysis of RNA-sequencing RNA-seq read count data for two sample groups it is known that highly expressed genes or longer genes are more likely to be differentially expressed which is called read count bias or gene length bias
9) In the past many algorithms have been developed for detecting differentially expressed genes DEGs from RNA-seq experiments including the one we developed XBSeq which paid special attention to the context-specific background noise that is ignored in conventional gene expression quantification and DE analysis of RNA-seq data
--------------------
Which thyroid hormone transporter is implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome ?
0) The exact molecular mechanisms by which the functional deficiency of the citrate transporter causes epilepsy and impairs neuronal development and function remain to be elucidated but available literature implicate both dysfunction of GABA γ-aminobutyrate signaling and hyperfunction of NMDA methyl-d-aspartate receptor signaling
1) The length polymorphism of the serotonin 5-HT transporter gene promoter region has been implicated in altered 5-HT function and in turn neuropsychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and depression
2) 5-Hydroxytryptamine 5-HT dopamine and norepinephrine are important monoamine neurotransmitters implicated in multiple brain mechanisms and regulated by high-affinity transmembrane monoamine transporters
3) One of these transporters the multi-drug resistance p-glycoprotein has been extensively described to confer treatment resistance to tumour cells as well as to regulate the intracellular levels of glucocorticoid hormones
4) Although the physiological mechanisms contributing to the development of major depression remain unclear several lines of evidence suggest that the catecholaminergic system involving the norepinephrine transporter NET is implicated in the etiology of major depression
5) Solute carrier family 22 member 2 SLC22A2 also known as organic cation transporter 2 OCT2 is predominantly expressed in the luminal membrane of airway epithelial cells and has been shown to mediate the transport of prostaglandins on the cyclooxygenase pathway which is regulated by aspirin blockage
6) The norepinephrine transporter NET SLC6A2 represents an important candidate gene for contribution to ADHD because it regulates catecholamine extracellular and tissue concentrations and contributes to executive functions disrupted in ADHD and NET is a target for most effective ADHD therapeutics
7) With the discovery of monocarboxylate transporter 8 MCT8 as a specific thyroid hormone transporter and the finding that mutations in this transporter lead to a syndrome of severe psychomotor retardation and elevated serum 3,3 ,5 tri-iodothyronine levels known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome the interest in this area of research has greatly increased
8) In this review the roles of key factors of the monoamine system dopamine receptor genes 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor genes transporter genes tyrosine hydroxylase gene tryptophanhydroxylase gene and monoamine oxidase gene in alcohol dependence were discussed and strategies for further studies of molecular mechanisms were proposed based on gene knockout mice models generated in our laboratory
9) The importance was better documented by the phenotype observed in patients harboring mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 MCT8 gene immediately linked to Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome in which severe neurological findings are associated with abnormal TH levels

7) Previous studies showed that radiolabeled murine monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) 14C5 and its Fab and F ( ab ' ) 2 fragments , targeting αvβ5 integrin , have promising properties for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer .
8) Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) or TRAIL-receptor agonistic monoclonal antibodies promote apoptosis in most cancer cells , and the differential expression of TRAIL-R2 between tumor and normal tissues allows its exploitation as a tumor-associated antigen .
9) Targeted chemotherapy with the anti − CD33 − calicheamicin construct gemtuzumab ozogamicin has produced remissions in patients with relapsed AML and appears promising when used in combination with standard chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed AML .

Which are the main histone modifications associated with enhancers ?
0) These findings not only refine the repertoire of histone modifications at both active and poised gene enhancer elements but also raise the possibility that enhancers associated with distinct cellular functions are partitioned based on specific combinations of histone modifications
1) The reliance on transcriptional regulation to maintain pluripotency makes ESCs a valuable model to study the role of distal CREs such as enhancers in modulating gene expression to affect cell fate decisions
2) Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined
3) There is a growing body of evidence on association of enhancers with transcription factors co-activators histone chromatin marks and lncRNAs
4) Lineage studies indicate that the patterning of enhancers might be regulated by the intricate interplay between DNA methylation status the binding of specific transcription factors to enhancers and existing histone modifications
5) This review sets out to highlight the use of embryonic stem cells ESCs in the study of enhancers emphasizing that ESC have become an ideal model system for questions regarding mammalian transcriptional regulation
6) Although four decades ago it was proposed that animal evolution was mainly driven by changes in cis-regulatory DNA elements controlling gene expression rather than in protein-coding sequences only now are powerful bioinformatics and experimental approaches available to accelerate studies into how the evolution of transcriptional enhancers contributes to novel forms and functions
7) We have addressed this question by developing a new approach to disentangle the sources of selection acting on exonic enhancers in which we model the evolutionary rates of every possible substitution as a function of their effects on both protein sequence and enhancer activity
8) Gene expression in higher eukaryotes is precisely regulated in time and space through the interplay between promoters and gene-distal regulatory regions known as enhancers
9) One consequence of the variability in the distance separating enhancers and their target promoters is that it is difficult to determine which elements are involved in the regulation of a particular gene

Is Crohn 's disease ( CD ) linked to the consumption of refrigerated food ?
0) While dietary patterns high in fresh fruits and vegetables and low in red meats , such as the Mediterranean diet , decrease the risk of chronic diseases , the Western diet , characterized by high intake of red meat , animal fat , sweets , and desserts and low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products , increases risk of chronic diseases .
1) When considered collectively , dAGE research results are consistent with the '' fructositis '' hypothesis , which states that intake of foods and beverages with high fructose-to-glucose ratios ( HFCS-sweetened foods and beverages , agave syrup , crystalline fructose , apple juice , and apple juice blends ) promotes the intestinal in situ formation of readily absorbed , proinflammatory extracellular , newly identified , fructose-associated AGE , an overlooked source of immunogenic AGEs .

0) The Smith-Waterman algorithm which produces the optimal pairwise alignment between two sequences is frequently used as a key component of fast heuristic read mapping and variation detection tools for next-generation sequencing data
1) The problem of finding an optimal structural alignment for a pair of superimposed proteins is often amenable to the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm which runs in time proportional to the product of lengths of the sequences being aligned
2) While the quadratic running time is acceptable for computing a single alignment of two fixed protein structures the time complexity becomes a bottleneck when running the Smith-Waterman routine multiple times in order to find a globally optimal superposition and alignment of the input proteins
3) Pairwise sequence alignment techniques such as Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms are applications of dynamic programming on pairwise sequence alignment problems
4) Smith-Waterman S-W algorithm is an optimal sequence alignment method for biological databases but its computational complexity makes it too slow for practical purposes
5) An algorithm for constructing a set of three to six alignments has been developed of which the accuracy of the best alignment exceeds on the average the accuracy of the best alignment that can be constructed using the Smith-Waterman algorithm
6) To infer homology and subsequently gene function the Smith-Waterman SW algorithm is used to find the optimal local alignment between two sequences

8) Although there are other graphical processor unit implementations of the Smith-Waterman algorithm SW is the only one publicly available that can produce sequence alignments on genome-wide scale
9) All popular algorithms of pair-wise alignment of protein primary structures e.g. Smith-Waterman SW FASTA BLAST et al. utilize only amino acid sequences

1) The eukaryotic family of so-called Lipid transfer proteins Anchored at Membrane contact sites LAMs all contain both a sterol-specific lipid transfer domain in the StARkin superfamily related to StART/Bet v1 and one or more transmembrane helices anchoring them in the endoplasmic reticulum ER making them interesting subjects for study in relation to sterol metabolism
2) PDZ proteins such as the Na H exchanger regulatory factor NHERF family act to stabilize and organize membrane targeting of multiple transmembrane proteins including many clinically relevant drug transporters
3) The difficulty of inferring the secondary or tertiary structure of transmembrane proteins using experimental techniques has led to a surge of interest in applying techniques from machine learning and bioinformatics to infer secondary structure from primary structure in these proteins
4) They belong to the superfamily of P-type ATPases their four basic isoforms share the essential properties of the reaction cycle and the general membrane topography motif of 10 transmembrane domains and three large cytosolic units
5) ABC proteins also share common structural motifs with voltage-gated ion channels transporters for glucose and neurotransmitters and even adenylylcyclase
6) This is clearly apparent for one superfamily of molecules the so-called ATP-binding cassette ABC proteins which behave as ATP-dependent ion channels and/or transporters for a wide variety of substrates
7) An important subfamily of membrane proteins are the transmembrane alpha-helical proteins in which the membrane-spanning regions are made up of alpha-helices

1) MiRNAs regulate cardiac mitochondrial apoptosis by exert their effects on mitochondrial fission and fusion reactive oxygen species ROS generation and Cahomeostasis Bcl-2 family members and other mitochondrial function proteins
2) Prospective clues to enhance myocardial regeneration are the newly discovered cells termed telocytes formerly called interstitial Cajal-like cells which are believed to nurse or guide the endogenous and exogenous stem cells for activation and commitment but they also act as supporting cells for progenitor cells migration toward injured myocardium
3) Key molecules in sensing cellular stress situations seem to be the PGC-family of transcriptional co-activators which are key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis
4) Recent work has identified several stress-regulated pathways that affect mitochondrial biogenesis through modulation of the activity of PGC-1α

0) I-kappa B kinase 2 IKK2 or IKK-beta is one of the most crucial signaling kinases for activation of NF-kappa B a transcription factor that is important for inflammation cell survival and differentiation
1) The main question which is still only partially answered is to understand how an NF-kappaB activating signal leads to the activation of the kinase subunits allowing them to phosphorylate their targets and eventually induce nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB dimers
2) A pivotal regulator of all inducible NF-kappaB signaling pathways is the IkappaB kinase IKK complex that consists of two kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta and a regulatory subunit named NF-kappaB essential modulator NEMO
3) Here we summarize the properties of regulatory subunits NAP1 and TANK and the mode of activation of NF-kappaB and IRF-3 in conjunction with the unique properties of the TLR3 function
4) The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ and a regulatory subunit NEMO/IKK γ that regulates the canonical NF-κB pathway whereas IKKα regulates the non-canonical pathway
5) The non-canonical NF-κB pathway is an important arm of NF-κB signaling that predominantly targets activation of the p52/RelB NF-κB complex
6) Canonical and noncanonical nuclear factor kappaB NF-kappaB signaling are the two basic pathways responsible for the release of NF-kappaB dimers from their inhibitors
7) TLRs Toll-like receptors are an important class of pathogen-sensing proteins which signal the presence of a pathogen by activating transcription factors such as NF-kappaB nuclear factor kappaB
8) In NF-kappaB signaling cascades IkappaB kinase alpha IKKalpha and IKKbeta are key molecules that predominantly mediate noncanonical and canonical pathways respectively

Which are the genes thought to be regulated by EWS / FLI ?
0) FUS , together with Ewing 's sarcoma protein ( EWS ) and TATA-binding protein associated factor 15 ( TAF15 ) , make up the FET family of DNA/RNA binding proteins that share functional homology and have the potential to interact .
1) Taken together , we have identified LRWD1 as a novel regulator of EWS-FLI1 driven cell viability in A673/TR/shEF Ewing sarcoma cells , shown association between high LRWD1 mRNA expression and aggressive disease and identified processes by which LRWD1 may promote oncogenesis in Ewing sarcoma .
2) The most frequently occurring chromosomal translocation that gives rise to the Ewing 's sarcoma family of tumors ( ESFT ) is the chimeric fusion gene EWS-FLI1 that encodes an oncogenic protein composed of the N terminus of EWS and the C terminus of FLI1 .
3) Loss of FUS in the nucleus can impair alternative splicing and/or transcription , whereas dysfunction of FUS in the cytoplasm , especially in the dendritic spines of neurons , can cause mRNA destabilization .
4) Amongst the commonly altered genes in cancer is the cell-cycle regulator cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B ( Cdkn2b ) , whose expression is negatively regulated by protein products of BMI1 proto-oncogene ( Bmi1 ) , MYC proto-oncogene ( Myc ) and T-box gene transcription factor 2 ( Tbx2 ) genes .
5) A recent study shows that an alteration of EWS in Ewing sarcoma alters the dynamics of RNA polymerase II over the CCND1 proto-oncogene encoding cyclin D1 , leading to an increase in its transcription and to an alteration of splicing that results in high levels of the oncogenic cyclin D1b splice isoform .
6) Recently , several studies have shown that missense mutations of EWSR1 genes are known to be associated with central nervous system disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) .
7) To clarify the function of chimeric EWS-FLI1 proteins , an identification of a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) in the EWS , FLI1 and EWS-FLI1 proteins is important because the chimeric oncoprotein may lose or gain NLS function different from native proteins resulting in different subcellular localization , and in deregulated gene expression .
8) The Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 gene ( EWSR1 ) , also known as EWS , is fused to a number of different partner genes as a result of chromosomal translocation in diverse sarcomas .
9) FUS is a member of the FET protein family that includes Ewing 's sarcoma ( EWS ) and TATA-binding protein-associated factor 2N ( TAF15 ) .

Which are the enzymes involved in the addition of 7-methylguanosine in mRNA ?
0) The creation of translation-competent mRNA is dependent on RNA polymerase II transcripts being modified by addition of the 7-methylguanosine ( m7G ) cap .
1) At least two decapping enzymes , Dcp2 and Nudt16 , and an array of decapping regulatory proteins remove the m ( 7 ) G cap from an mRNA exposing the 5 ' - end to exonucleolytic decay .
2) The 5 ' cap consists of 7-methylguanosine ( mG ) linked by a 5 ' -5 ' - triphosphate bridge to messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and acts as the master regulator of mRNA turnover and translation initiation in eukaryotes .
3) The interferon-induced enzymes 2 ' -5 ' - oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) and RNase L are key components of innate immunity involved in sensory and effector functions following viral infections .
4) Analogues of the eukaryotic messenger RNA 5 ' end ( m ( 7 ) G cap ) are useful tools for studying mRNA fate and serve as reagents for in vitro preparation of 5 ' capped mRNAs .
5) By precluding inhibition of other cap-binding proteins by short m ( 7 ) GpppN-containing mRNA fragments , DcpS plays an important role in the cap-dependent mRNA metabolism .

Which are the bioinformatics tools for gene structure prediction ?
0) Predicting the function of an unknown protein is an essential goal in bioinformatics
1) Predicting disease genes for a particular genetic disease is very challenging in bioinformatics
2) In silico analysis can also differentiate subtle consequences of coding DNA variants and remains the major tool to predict potential effects of non-coding DNA variants on gene transcription and/or pre-mRNA splicing
3) Our goal is to develop a new tool for functional prediction e.g. prediction of Enzyme Commission number which can be used to complement and support other techniques based on sequence or structure information
4) The Comparative Marker Selection suite consists of three modules that allow users to apply and compare different methods of computing significance for each marker gene a viewer to assess the results and a tool to create derivative datasets and marker lists based on user-defined significance criteria
5) Due to the relatively large gap of knowledge between gene identification and gene function the ability to construct a computational model describing gene function from sequence information has become an important area of research
6) Recently with the development of gene signatures which integrate rather than replace the clinical predictors in the prediction rule the focus has been moved to the validation of the added predictive value of a gene signature i.e. to the verification that the inclusion of the new gene signature in a prediction model is able to improve its prediction ability
7) The results of jackknife tests on four working datasets show that our method obtains satisfactory prediction accuracies by extracting features solely based on PSSM and could serve as a very promising tool to predict protein structural class

Which protein is required for Argonaute 2 recruitment to stress granules and P-bodies ?
0) Human Argonaute 2 ( hAgo2 ) , the catalytic core component of the RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC ) , can be recruited to SGs as well as P-bodies ( PBs ) indicating that the dynamic intracellular distribution of hAgo2 in SGs , in PBs or at other sub-cellular sites could be related to the efficiency of the RNA interference ( RNAi ) machinery .
1) The known role of Argonaute proteins in miRNA-mediated translational repression and siRNA-directed mRNA cleavage ( i.e. , Argonaute 2 ) has prompted speculation that the association of Argonautes with these granules may reflect the activity of RNAi in vivo .
2) In this chapter , we describe methods to analyze P-bodies and stress granules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , including procedures to determine if a protein or mRNA can accumulate in either granule , if an environmental perturbation or mutation affects granule size and number , and granule quantification methods .
3) We recently reported that the Huntington disease protein huntingtin ( Htt ) associates with Argonaute ( Ago ) and localizes to cytoplasmic P-bodies , which serve as sites of mRNA storage , degradation , and small RNA-mediated gene silencing .
4) Processing bodies ( PBs ) and stress granules ( SGs ) are two highly conserved cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein foci that contain translationally repressed mRNAs together with proteins from the mRNA metabolism .
5) Here we show that GW-bodies containing GW182 and AGO2 , two main components of the RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC ) , are distinct from P-bodies due to their congregation with endosomes and MVBs .
6) In this paper , we address a role of Like-Sm ( LSm ) proteins in formation of P-bodies and provide evidence that depletion of nuclear LSm8 increases the number of P-bodies , while LSm8 overexpression leads to P-body loss .
7) The signature families of proteins within oocyte RNPs include Vasa and other RNA-binding proteins , decapping activators and enzymes , Argonaute family proteins , and translation initiation complex proteins .
8) Key effectors of microRNA ( miRNA ) - mediated RNA interference ( RNAi ) , such as Argonaute-2 ( Ago2 ) , miRNAs , and their cognate mRNAs , are localized to these structures ; however , the precise role that P-bodies and their component proteins play in small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated RNAi remains unclear .
9) Here we have shown that geldanamycin , a well-characterized HSP90 inhibitor , abolishes P-bodies and significantly reduces Argonaute and GW182 protein levels but does not affect the miRNA level and the efficiency of miRNA-mediated gene repression ; however , it significantly impairs siRNA loading and the efficacy of exogenous siRNA .

Which are the newly identified DNA nucleases that can be used to treat thalassemia ?
0) While the addition of the wild-type beta-globin gene is naturally suited for treating beta-thalassemia several alternatives have been proposed for the treatment of sickle cell disease using either gamma or mutant beta-globin gene addition trans-splicing or RNA interference
1) Although making a sequence-specific nuclease to enhance correction of a specific HBB mutation by homology-directed repair HDR is becoming straightforward targeting various HBB mutations of β-thal is still challenging because individual guide RNA as well as a donor DNA template for HDR of each type of HBB gene mutation have to be selected and validated
2) Triplex-forming oligonucleotides constitute an interesting DNA sequence-specific tool that can be used to target cleaving or cross-linking agents transcription factors or nucleases to a chosen site on the DNA
3) The clinical severity of beta-thalassemia major and the sickle cell syndromes targets them as priority genetic diseases for prevention programs which incorporates population screening to identify heterozygotes with the option of prenatal diagnosis for carrier couples
4) Importantly during the last years additional curative options for patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease are being developed based on the ability to manipulate the genome by employing programmable nucleases and next-generation genome-modifying tools thus providing the exciting prospects of targeted in-situ gene correction
5) Genome engineering is an emerging strategy to treat monogenic diseases that relies on the use of engineered nucleases to correct mutations at the nucleotide level
6) A promising alternative is the use of endonucleases such as ZFNs TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a double-stranded break in the DNA and thus induce homology-directed repair
7) The field of gene therapy was recently revolutionized by the introduction of programmable nucleases including ZFNs TALENs and CRISPR which target specific genomic loci with high efficacy and precision
8) Recent progress in gene editing technology using tailor-made nucleases such as meganucleases MNs zinc finger nucleases ZFNs TAL effector nucleases TALENs and more recently CRISPR/Cas9 has significantly broadened our ability to precisely modify target sites in the human genome
9) Genome editing using programmable endonucleases is a powerful tool for modifying target genome sequences and has been extensively used over the last decade to correct in vitro genetic defects of many single-gene diseases

2) In contrast to previous beliefs , Alu inserts do not necessarily represent weak or cryptic PASs ; instead , they often constitute the major or the unique PAS in a gene , adding to the growing list of Alu exaptations .
3) Only LINE-1 ( L1 ) , an autonomous non-Long Terminal Repeat ( LTR ) retrotransposon , and its non-autonomous partners-such as the retropseudogenes , SVA , and the SINE , Alu-are currently active human retroelements .
4) Currently active retrotransposable elements include Long INterspersed Elements ( LINEs ) , Short INterspersed Elements ( SINEs ) and SVA ( SINE/VNTR/Alu ) elements .
5) L1 expression and retrotransposition in cancer cells might cause transcriptional deregulation , insertional mutations , DNA breaks , and an increased frequency of recombinations , contributing to genome instability .
6) Here , we describe a family of Mutator-like DNA transposons in Medicago truncatula targeting TA microsatellites .
7) MuTAnT : a family of Mutator-like transposable elements targeting TA microsatellites in Medicago truncatula .

What are the effects of depleting protein km23-1 ( DYNLRB1 ) in a cell ?
0) Valosin-containing protein ( VCP ) is a novel IQ motif-containing GTPase activating protein 1 ( IQGAP1 ) - interacting protein .
1) CNOT3 depletion increases the population of mitotic-arrested cells and specifically increases the expression of MAD1 mRNA and its protein product that plays a part in the spindle assembly checkpoint .
2) To study SMN and SMNΔ7 degradation in the cell , we have used tagged versions at the N - ( Flag ) or C-terminus ( V5 ) of both proteins .
3) Using pull-down and co-fractionation assays in cultured human and rat astrocytes , we show here that MLC1 intracellular domains pull-down the DGC proteins syntrophin , dystrobrevin , Kir4 .1 and caveolin-1 , the structural protein of caveolae , thereby supporting a role for DGC and caveolar structures in MLC1 function .
4) Sequestosome 1/p62 ( SQSTM1 , hereafter referred to as p62 ) is a ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein involved in cell signaling , oxidative stress , and autophagy .
5) These results provide evidence for the role of the cytosolic interactions of IKAP in cell adhesion and migration , and support the notion that cell-motility deficiencies could contribute to FD .
6) Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts ( MLC ) is a rare congenital leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the MLC1 gene that encodes a membrane protein of unknown function .
7) We find that the microtubule-associated protein PRC1 ( protein required for cytokinesis 1 ) , which plays a key role in organizing anti-parallel microtubule in the central spindle in cytokinesis , is overexpressed in lung cancer cell lines compared to normal cells .
8) We have recently reported that RINT-1 , together with the dynamitin-interacting protein ZW10 and others , is associated with syntaxin 18 , an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) - localized SNARE involved in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi .
9) The aim of this review is to highlight key findings that support an antiapoptotic role for SMN in modulating cell survival and raise possibilities for new therapeutic approaches .

Is the gene DUX4 epigenetically regulated in somatic cells ?
0) We found also that ectopically expressed DUX4 up-regulates the endogenous human FRG1 gene in healthy muscle cells , while DUX4 knockdown leads to a decrease in FRG1 expression in FSHD muscle cells .
1) SIRT1 down-regulation leads to reactivation of key developmental genes such as the neuroretinal morphogenesis effectors DLL4 , TBX3 , and PAX6 , which are epigenetically repressed by this histone deacetylase in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells .
2) The goal of the study is to identity proteins , which interact with the promoter region of double homeobox protein 4 ( DUX4 ) gene known to be causative for the autosomal dominant disorder Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy ( FSHD ) .
3) Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that DUX4 recruits p300 to its target gene , ZSCAN4 , displaces histone H3 from the center of its binding site , and induces H3K27Ac in its vicinity , but C-terminal deleted DUX4 does not .
4) Here we show that deregulation of the homeobox transcription factor gene DUX4 and the ETS transcription factor gene ERG is a hallmark of a subtype of B-progenitor ALL that comprises up to 7 % of B-ALL .
5) DUX4 constitutes a major candidate pathogenic protein for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD ) , the third most common form of inherited myopathy .
6) Transgenic Drosophila for Investigating DUX4 and FRG1 , Two Genes Associated with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy ( FSHD ) .
7) The DUX4 protein is a 52-kDa transcription factor that initiates a large gene deregulation cascade leading to muscle atrophy , inflammation , differentiation defects , and oxidative stress , which are the key features of FSHD .
8) We find that expression of even low levels of DUX4 is incompatible with pluripotency : DUX4-expressing ES cells downregulate pluripotency markers and rapidly differentiate even in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( BMP4 ) .
9) DUX4 gene functionality was questioned in the past because of its pseudogene-like structure , its location on repetitive telomeric DNA sequences ( i.e. junk DNA ) , and the elusive nature of both the DUX4 transcript and the encoded protein , DUX4 .

Which drugs acting via bradykinin system are effective for treatment of ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema ?
0) The bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant is effective in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema .
1) Inhibition of bradykinin metabolizing enzymes ( BMEs ) can cause acute angioedema , as demonstrated in a recent clinical trial in patients administered the antihypertensive , omapatrilat .
2) We hypothesize that the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant might be an effective therapy for ACEi-induced angioedema .
3) In recent years , some new drugs have been introduced in the treatment of bradykinin-mediated angioedema , such as bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist , icatibant , and kallikrein inhibitor , ecallantide , which allow to improve treatment outcomes .
4) The bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant is proven to be effective in the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema , and has also been reported effective in the treatment of angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors .
5) Medications recently developed , primarily icatibant and ecallantide , to control hereditary angioedema , a disorder also associated with kallikrein-kinin activation , have been used to treat ACEI angioedema with some success .
6) Acquired angioedema related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEI-AAE ) is well known , but other pharmaceutical agents also affect the degradation of bradykinin and substance P .
7) Three new treatments have recently become available : a kallikrein inhibitor that prevents bradykinin release , an antagonist of bradykinin receptors that blocks bradykinin action , and a recombinant human C1-INH molecule produced in transgenic rabbits that replaces the deficient protein .
8) Dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors are a class of oral diabetic agents that affect bradykinin and substance P degradation and therefore can lead to angioedema .
9) Angiotensin II receptor antagonists have been proposed as a replacement therapy after the occurrence of either an angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor-induced angioedema or cough .
--------------------
Which genes code for the alpha subunit of the DNA polymerase III in most Firmicutes ?
0) Pol ε is comprised of four subunits , the largest of which is encoded by the POLE gene and contains the catalytic polymerase and exonuclease activities .
1) To define the set of active SNAP ( c ) - dependent promoters in human cells , we have localized genome-wide four SNAP ( c ) subunits , GTF2B ( TFIIB ) , BRF2 , pol II , and pol III .
2) Human DNA polymerase theta ( pol or POLQ ) is a proofreading-deficient family A enzyme implicated in translesion synthesis ( TLS ) and perhaps in somatic hypermutation ( SHM ) of immunoglobulin genes .
3) According to the dimeric combination of alpha subunits , GC contents of eubacterial genomes were partitioned into three groups with distinct GC content variation spectra : dnaE1 ( full-spectrum ) , dnaE2/dnaE1 ( high-GC ) , and polC/dnaE3 ( low-GC ) .
4) Therefore , genomic GC content variability is believed to be governed primarily by the alpha subunit grouping of DNA polymerase III ; it is of essence in genome composition analysis to take full account of such a grouping principle .
5) Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells .
6) Thus , we propose that GC content is regulated by DNA polymerase and MMR system , and the absence of polC genes , which participate in the MMR system , may be the reason for the increase of GC content in Gram-positive bacteria such as Actinobacteria .
7) We show that the large majority of SNAP ( c ) - dependent promoters recruit POU2F1 and/or ZNF143 on their enhancer region , and a subset also recruits GABP , a factor newly implicated in SNAP ( c ) - dependent transcription .
8) DNA polymerase switching on homotrimeric PCNA at the replication fork of the euryarchaea Pyrococcus abyssi .
9) Replication of the chromosomes of low GC Gram-positive bacteria require two Pol IIIs , one of which , DnaE , appears to extend RNA primers a only short distance before handing the product off to the major replicase , PolC .

Is indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease ?
0) To examine whether antioxidant supplement use is associated with melanoma risk in light of recently published data from the Supplementation in Vitamins and Mineral Antioxidants SUVIMAX study which reported a 4-fold higher melanoma risk in women randomized to receive a supplement with nutritionally appropriate doses of antioxidants
1) Epidemiologic data suggest that antioxidant supplementation may be associated with a reduced risk of clinical events from atherosclerosis howere interventional trials only support a role for vitamin E in this regard
2) Large placebo-controlled studies using single antioxidants or combinations to prevent coronary heart disease have not shown antioxidant supplementation to be beneficial but sometimes rather harmful as exemplified by beta-carotene in smoking men
3) Most studies found that antioxidant supplements do not reduce the risk for cancer or prevent tumour growth at the contrary these interventions resulted in some cases to be harmful to the patients
4) Is it true that antioxidant supplements such as beta carotene vitamin A and vitamin E can raise my risk of death
5) The purpose of this study was to assess the use of oral antioxidant supplements in patients with late age-related macular degeneration AMD and to identify influencing factors that may affect the use of such supplements
6) Cancer patients take antioxidant supplements widely in order to prevent toxic side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy to normal tissues
7) Recently the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mine raux Antioxydants SU.VI.MAX study a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled primary prevention trial tested the efficacy of supplementation with a combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals at nutritional doses in reducing the cancer incidence in a general population not selected for risk factors
8) Results from randomized trials of antioxidant supplementation have cast doubt on observational data linking diets high in antioxidants to a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases
9) In some studies antioxidant supplements did not reduce the risk for cancer or prevent tumour growth at the contrary these interventions resulted in some cases to be harmful to the patients

Gene silencing can be achieved by RNA interference ( RNAi ) in eukaryotic organisms . What is the name of the analogous process in prokaryotic organisms ?
0) This gene silencing process is known as RNA silencing or RNA interference RNAi and in plants and nematodes it is associated with the production of a mobile signal that can travel from cell-to-cell and over long distances
1) RNA silencing or RNA interference RNAi refers to the small RNA-guided gene silencing mechanism conserved in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms from plants to mammals
2) First discovered as an ancient anti-viral response RNAi is now recognized as a natural regulatory mechanism for silencing gene expression in eukaryotes and as a powerful tool for investigating gene function
3) Because double-stranded RNA dsRNA mediated gene silencing is a conserved mechanism in many eukaryotes RNAi has become a valuable tool for unveiling gene function in many model insects
4) Recently RNAi or RNA silencing has arisen as a possible means by which Drosophila can react to a specific pathogens transposons and retroviral elements in a fashion similar to that of a traditional mammalian adaptive immune system instead of in a more generalized and genome encoded innate immune-based response
5) There is no doubt that in few years RNAi silencing approaches will become the tool of choice to knock-down genes in all groups of non-mammalian vertebrates fulfilling different purposes from basic research to animal therapeutics and drug discovery
6) RNA interference RNAi the process by which double stranded RNA induces the silencing of endogenous genes through the degradation of its correspondent messenger RNA has been used for post-transcriptional gene silencing allowing scientists to better understand gene function becoming a powerful tool in reverse genetics for in vivo and in vitro systems
7) RNA-mediated gene silencing in eukaryotes may have originated as surveillance mechanism to protect the organism from transposable elements and viruses and then evolved to specify chromosomal modifications and to regulate expression of a significant fraction of endogenous genes by microRNAs
8) RNAi has been found as a widespread natural phenomenon in eukaryotic cells and is also being used as a powerful experimental tool to explore gene function
9) This family of diverse molecular phenomena has a common exciting feature of gene silencing which is collectively called RNA interference abbreviated to as RNAi

List drugs included in the DHAP-R chemotherapy regiment .
0) To explore the clinical effects of T-VD regimen ( bortezomib + dexamethasone + thalidomid ) and T-VAD regimen ( vincristine + adriamycin + dexamethasone + thalidomide ) on the patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) .
1) Recommendation Key updates include the addition of olanzapine to antiemetic regimens for adults who receive high-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents or who experience breakthrough nausea and vomiting ; a recommendation to administer dexamethasone on day 1 only for adults who receive anthracycline and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy ; and the addition of a neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist for adults who receive carboplatin area under the curve ≥ 4 mg/mL per minute or high-dose chemotherapy , and for pediatric patients who receive high-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents .
2) Azathioprine is often the first-choice drug for long-term immunosuppression , and it is usually started together with steroids to allow tapering of steroids to the lowest dose possible .
3) The mechanisms of action of immunosuppressant drugs in MG fall into three main categories : inhibition of the cell cycle ( azathioprine , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil ) , immunosuppression of T cells ( steroids , ciclosporin and tacrolimus ) , and B-cell depletion ( rituximab ) .
4) Methotrexate ( MTX ) , a traditional antipsoriatic drug , is very frequently used either as monotherapy or in combination with other systemic drugs .
5) The American Diabetes Association recommends metformin as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes .
6) As cyclophosphamide is in clinical use for more than 40 years , there is a lot of experience using this drug for the treatment of cancer and as an immunosuppressive agent for the treatment of autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases .
7) Cyclosporine and methotrexate are the two preferred first-line immunosuppressive treatments in atopic dermatitis .
8) This review examines the most recent data on 5-aminosalicylate as a chemoprophylactic drug as well as ursodeoxycholic acid , folic acid , azathioprine , and 6-mercaptopurine .
9) Ciclosporin and cyclophosphamide should only be considered as a last resort , as these drugs can cause serious adverse events .

ROSIER scale is used for which disorder ?
0) The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician ( NPI-C ) scale is one of the best-known scales for evaluating the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia .
1) The Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale ( CDS ) is a self-rating questionnaire constructed to capture the frequency and duration of depersonalization symptoms over the last six months .
2) Of the four identified scales available in German language , the Manie-Selbstbeurteilungs-Skala MSS by Bräunig et al. , which is a translation of the Self-Rating Manic Inventory SRMI by Shugar et al. , is the best validated instrument both for diagnostic purposes and for measuring symptom severity during the course of illness .
3) To assess insomnia , the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , a generic scale , and three disease-specific scales : the Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale ( PDSS ) , the PDSS-2 , and Scales for outcomes in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) - Sleep-Nocturnal Sleep subscale are discussed .
4) To validate the adapted Italian version of the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale ( NMSS ) , a tool to assess non-motor symptoms ( NMS ) in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .
5) In this context , the neuropsychiatric inventory ( NPI ) is the most widely used comprehensive tool designed to measure neuropsychiatric Symptoms in geriatric patients with dementia .
6) The Life Participation Scale for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) - Child Version ( LPS-C ) was developed to capture treatment-related improvements in adaptive functioning , including quality of life , social development , and emotion regulation , that may be missed by scales that assess only the 18 ADHD symptoms in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition ( DSM-IV ) .
7) The Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) is one of the most popular and frequently used instruments for assessing so-called challenging behavior in individuals with dementia in research practice .
8) Innovations in DSM5 include dimensional diagnosis of schizophrenia ( SZ ) and other psychotic ( OP ) disorders using the symptom severity scale ( SS-DSM5 ) .
9) Pediatric delirium ( PD ) is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder often seen at the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) .

What is known about MER41 repeat sequences ?
0) Intergenic repeat units of 127-bp RU-1 and 168-bp RU-2 as well as a newly-found class of 103-bp RU-3 represent small mobile sequences in enterobacterial genomes present in multiple intergenic regions
1) Recombination between homologous but non-allelic stretches of DNA such as gene families segmental duplications and repeat elements is an important source of mutation
2) We delineated the consensus sequence G TC G A GATTA G BG A for repeat 4 and showed that binding sites for GTF3 in enhancers for Troponin I and homeobox c8 HOXc8 are in very good agreement with this motif
3) To study the evolution of repeated sequences and the influence of repeat characteristics on their sequence divergence we sequenced and characterized a single complete IGS from 11 daphniid species and analyzed their repeat arrays along with those from an additional 21 species of arthropods
4) ProRepeat offers powerful analysis tools for finding biological interesting properties of repeats such as the strong position bias of leucine repeats in the N-terminus of eukaryotic protein sequences the differences of repeat abundance among proteomes the functional classification of repeat containing proteins and GC content constrains of repeats corresponding codons
5) A novel repeat sequence with a conserved secondary structure is described from two nonadjacent introns of the ATP synthase beta-subunit gene in sea stars of the order Forcipulatida Echinodermata Asteroidea
6) In order to estimate how much of the observed sequences have the repeat origin we describe the adaptation of a text segmentation algorithm based on dynamic programming to the mapping of the ancient expansion events
7) Motivated by the recent discovery of a tri-nucleotide repeat associated genetic defect in Arabidopsis thaliana this study takes a cross-species approach to investigating these repeat tracts with the goal of using commonalities between species to identify potential disease-related properties
8) And hence because of its great significance we have initiated this study to analyze complete genome of Arabidopsis thaliana for the prevalence of mono di tri tetra penta and hexa mer repeats in the coding and non-coding regions of the chromosome and to map their exact position on the sequence
9) How do we define sequence motifs and why should we use sequence logos instead of consensus sequences to represent them
