What is the association between GERD and gluten ?
0) What GERD does causes discomfort and/or pain with or without destroying the mucosa causes stricture or stenosis preventing food from being swallowed sets the stage for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma invades the surrounding lands to harass the peaceful oropharyngeal laryngeal and broncho-pulmonary territories reminds us that we are not only human but that we are dust and ashes
1) Nonceliac gluten sensitivity NCGS is the clinical term used to describe gastrointestinal GI and/or extraintestinal symptoms associated with gluten ingestion
2) Given the strong association between hiatal hernia and GERD and their risk for developing chronic microaspiration the prominent airway-centered FF in UIP might predict the presence of chronic microaspiration acknowledging that GERD and proton pump inhibitor/histamine -2 receptor antagonist use failed to demonstrate a significant association
3) What is the role of endoscopy and oesophageal biopsies in the management of GERD
4) In this article we review the pathophysiology of GERD its effect on the immune system the effect of acid-blocking medications on allergic responses as well as several common atopic conditions that have been associated with GERD including asthma chronic rhinosinusitis CRS allergic rhinitis AR atopic dermatitis AD contact dermatitis CD food allergies proton pump inhibitor PPI responsive esophageal eosinophilia PPI-REE and eosinophilic esophagitis EoE
5) In this paper we will briefly review GERD AF and hiatal hernias consider the available literature covering the association between these diseases and provide further insight into the topic in general
6) The aim of this research was to conduct a systematic review on the association between dental erosion DE and gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD and the effect of saliva 's flow rate buffering capacity and oral microbial changes caused by GERD
7) CD4 T cells specific for post-translationally modified gluten peptides bound to the disease-predisposing HLA-DQ2 or HLADQ8 molecules are typically found in patients with CD explaining the strong association between these HLA-alleles and the occurrence of CD 1 2
8) Although there is not enough evidence that certain substances in a diet could lead to GERD symptoms the literature suggests that there might be a relationship between reflux development and salt salted foods chocolate fatty foods and fizzy drinks
9) This review considers and emphasizes the association between GERD and non-digestive tract conditions including atrial fibrillation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease primary pulmonary fibrosis and energy metabolism related to diet

Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria ?
0) As pathogenic Escherichia coli or carcinogenic Helicobacter pylori can alter genome integrity through DNA double-strand breaks , leading to chromosomal instability and eventually cancer , our findings highlight possible new routes for further investigations of P. aeruginosa in cancer biology and they identify ATM as a potential target molecule for drug design .
1) Recent evidence suggests that the nucleotide pool is a significant target for oxidants and that oxidized nucleotides , once incorporated into genomic DNA , can lead to the induction of a DNA strand break-associated DDR that triggers senescence in normal cells and in cells sustaining oncogene activation .
2) Strand breaks thus created can be repaired by different mechanisms , including homologous recombination ( HR ) , one of the key mechanisms maintaining genome stability [ A. Britt , DNA damage and repair in plants , Annu .
3) Using extracts of an XPV lymphoblast cell line ( GM2449C ) that has a truncating mutation in the RAD30 gene , we investigated the effect of a ( 6-4 ) photoproduct and a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer ( CPD ) , at a unique - TT - site on either the leading or lagging strand , on plasmid DNA replication .
4) While MOBP plasmids are most frequently targeted in the region entering the recipient cell last ( lagging region ) , MOBF plasmids are mostly targeted in the region entering the recipient cell first ( leading region ) .
5) In eukaryotes , MMR is believed to be directed to the nascent strand by preexisting discontinuities such as gaps between Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand or breaks in the leading strand generated by the mismatch-activated endonuclease of the MutL homologs PMS1 in yeast and PMS2 in vertebrates .
6) We developed an anti-gene peptide nucleic acid ( PNA ) for selective inhibition of MYCN transcription in neuroblastoma cells , targeted against a unique sequence in the antisense DNA strand of exon 2 of MYCN and linked at its NH ( 2 ) terminus to a nuclear localization signal peptide .
7) Damage to DNA can include DNA strand breaks , point mutations due to DNA adducts , as well as alterations in methylation patterns leading to activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors .
8) Nucleolytic processing enzymes such as the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 / CtIP complex , Flap endonuclease ( FEN1 ) and the apurinic endonucleases ( APE1 and APE2 ) also act in the chemical `` cleansing '' of DNA breaks to prevent genomic instability and disease , and promote progression of DNA - and RNA-DNA damage response ( DDR and RDDR ) pathways .
9) By contrast , generation of a DNA single-strand break ( SSB ) , or nick , can stimulate gene correction without the problems of DSB repair because the uncut DNA strand acts as a template to permit healing without alteration of genetic material .
--------------------
Is there any link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates ?
0) Conserved noncoding elements CNEs in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers but a critical issue is how well orthologous CNE sequences retain the same activity in their respective species a characteristic important for generalization of model organism studies
1) Although few noncoding elements are highly conserved between Drosophila and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae we find that A. gambiae regions orthologous to Drosophila GRBs contain an equivalent distribution of noncoding elements highly conserved in the yellow fever mosquito Aëdes aegypti and coincide with regions of ancient microsynteny between Drosophila and mosquitoes
2) We found zebrafish conserved noncoding elements CNEs with pan-vertebrate as well as fish-specific orthologous sequences from across 200 kb of the zebrafish fgf8a genomic regulatory block to direct reporter expression in patterns consistent with the expression pattern of fgf8a
3) In vertebrates conserved noncoding elements CNEs are functionally constrained sequences that can show striking conservation over 400 million years of evolutionary distance and frequently are located megabases away from target developmental genes
4) We found 113,070 noncoding elements conserved between the two species amounting to 3.3 of the genome
5) Among conserved noncoding elements CNEs that function as enhancers in vertebrate genomes those that are maintained near paralogous genes are of particular interest given their ancient origins
6) These elements are different from other conserved noncoding elements and appear to be important regulatory innovations that became fixed following the emergence of vertebrates from the sea to the land
7) Although gene order in hox and other gene clusters has long been known to be conserved because of shared regulatory sequences or overlapping transcriptional units the chromosomal areas found through insertional hotspots contain only one or a few developmental regulatory genes as well as phylogenetically unrelated genes
8) Conserved noncoding elements CNCs are an abundant feature of vertebrate genomes
9) Vertebrate genomes contain thousands of conserved noncoding elements CNEs that often function as tissue-specific enhancers

--------------------
Which protein pathway is regulating SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3a to control cell proliferation ?
0) The mTOR pathway controls cell proliferation by regulating the FoxO3a transcription factor via SGK1 kinase
1) These results suggest that mTORC1 in coordination with mTORC2 controls cell proliferation by regulating FoxO3a gene expression and SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Ser314
2) Our results define an IFN-induced IKKε signaling pathway of specific STAT1 phosphorylation and IFIT2 expression that imparts innate antiviral immunity to restrict WNV infection and control viral pathogenesis
3) It has been suggested that increased ROMK activity because of SGK1-mediated inhibition of WNK4 plays a role in promoting renal K secretion in response to elevated serum K or high K HK intake
4) EPO and cEPO regulate the HDAC5 phosphorylation at two critical sites Ser259 and Ser498 through a protein kinase D PKD dependent pathway
5) It has been demonstrated that serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 SGK1 and the downstream transcription factor forkhead box O1 FoxO1 plays a critical role in the differentiation of T helper 17 cells/regulatory T cells Th17/Treg
6) Protein phosphorylation states can mediate complex formation as well as regulate protein function and this is important for cellular physiology but can likewise contribute to the development of neuropathological conditions
7) Mechanisms employed by SGK1 in transport regulation include direct phosphorylation of target transport proteins phosphorylation and thus activation of other transport regulating kinases stabilization of membrane proteins by phosphorylation and thus inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2 as well as stimulation of transport protein expression by upregulation transcription factors e.g. nuclear factor kappa-B NFκB and by fostering of protein translation
8) Collectively these findings suggest a novel role for GnTs in regulating RIG-I/TBK1 pathway-directed IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-β induction and define virulence determinants within GnTs that may permit the attenuation of pathogenic hantaviruses
9) SGK1 negatively regulates the pro-apoptotic transcription factor Forkhead box O3a FoxO3a via phosphorylation and exclusion from the nucleus

--------------------
Which protein is affected by dusp8 activation ?
0) Exchange protein activated by cAMP ( EPAC ) is a family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) for the small Ras-like GTPases Rap , and is being considered as a vital mediator of cAMP signaling in parallel with the principal cAMP target protein kinase A ( PKA ) .
1) In a recent paper published in Science Signaling , Junger and colleagues show that adenosine 5 ' - triphosphate release and signaling through purinergic P2 receptors upon neutrophil activation by bacterial and inflammatory stimuli represents an important mechanism for effective neutrophil functional response and host protection .
2) Recently , the structure of full-length TRPM2 from zebrafish was published ( Huang et al. , 2018 ) proposing a new activation mechanism - is it really a paradigm shift or just reflects evolution of the channel ?
3) The most rapid are of growth in recent years has been the realization that signaling through both G-protein coupled receptors and adhesion receptors is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation , recruitment of complexes of SH2 , SH3 , and proline-rich signaling molecules to appropriate locations in the cell , and on activation of members of the Ras superfamily of proteins .
4) Although some data support a role for certain BH3-only proteins , such as Bim or tBid , to directly activate Bax , others have led to the conclusion that BH3-only proteins act indirectly by antagonizing the prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins , thereby allowing Bax activation to proceed .
5) While the role of phospholipase C activity in growth factor regulation of cell proliferation remains to be clarified , the selective growth factor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 is an interesting example of enzyme-substrate interaction at the crossroads of two important intracellular signaling pathways .
6) The theme that is emerging is that these tyrosine kinases may serve to phosphorylate submembranous proteins including receptors for cytoplasmic domains or components of the submembranous cytoskeleton of adhesion-receptor cytoskeleton complexes that can then recruit and activate appropriate signaling molecules .
7) Recently , a series of studies have begun to define the mechanism of integrin activation by demonstrating that binding of a cytoskeletal protein , talin , to integrin beta subunit cytoplasmic tail is a last common step in integrin activation .
8) A result of this activation process is the induction of a number of genes , including those encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , and interferon ( IFN ) - gamma which have important immunoregulatory effects .
9) Thus the association of the cytoskeletal protein talin with integrin beta cytoplasmic domains is a critical step during integrin activation , and regulation of this step may be a final common element in the signalling pathways that control integrin activation .
--------------------
Is the long non- coding RNA malat-1 up or downregulated in cancer ?
0) Long non‑coding RNA RP1‑163G9 .1 is downregulated in gastric adenocarcinoma and is associated with a poor prognosis

In which cells are gasdermins expressed ?
0) GSDMD belongs to a family of poorly studied gasdermins , expressed in the skin and mucosa , which can also form membrane pores .
1) The rupture of the plasma membrane exhibits the `` point of no return '' for the immunogenicity of regulated cell death , explaining why apoptosis , a highly organized cell death subroutine with long-lasting plasma membrane integrity , elicits hardly any immune response .
2) By means of regulated necrosis , immunogenic damage-associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) and highly reactive organelles such as lysosomes , peroxisomes and mitochondria are released from the dying cells , thereby causing an overwhelming immunologic response .
3) Rotavirus specifically infects the intestinal epithelial cells in the host small intestine and has evolved strategies to antagonize interferon and NF-κB signalling , raising the question as to whether other host factors participate in antiviral responses in intestinal mucosa .
4) Intracellular pattern-recognition receptors , including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors ( NLRs ) , absent in melanoma 2 , and cysteine aspartate-specific protease ( caspase ) -4 / 5/11 recognize various pathogen-associated molecular patterns and danger-associated molecular patterns and assemble protein complexes called `` inflammasomes . ''
5) Canonical inflammasome activation induces a caspase-1 / gasdermin D ( Gsdmd ) - dependent lytic cell death called pyroptosis that promotes antimicrobial host defense but may contribute to sepsis .
6) In a distinct setting , additionally interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) is expressed during pyroptosis , initiated by gasdermin-mediated plasma membrane rupture .
7) Upon drug treatment , the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway was engaged and the mobilized caspase-3 protease cleaved and activated gasdermin E ( GSDME , encoded by ) , which permeabilized cytoplasmic membrane and executed cell-lytic pyroptosis .
8) We also found that activation of caspase 1 in iNKT cells results in processing of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β as well as cleavage of the pyroptotic protein gasdermin D , which generates a membrane pore-forming fragment to produce pyroptotic cell death .
9) Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is caused by infection with intracellular pathogens and activation of canonical or noncanonical inflammasomes .
--------------------
Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria ?
0) Our data suggest that the coordinate action of CSA and CSB , as part of the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery , regulates the recruitment timing of DNA-binding factors and provide explanations about the mechanism of transcription arrest following genotoxic stress .
1) These findings show that in mammalian cells a RNA polymerase I or RNA polymerase II transcript truncated by a lesion in the template strand may be discarded unless repair is accomplished rapidly by a mechanism that does not displace stalled RNA polymerases .
2) Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd , an ATP-dependent DNA translocase .
3) Our data rule out defective transcription-coupled repair as the cause of the increased sensitivity of CS cells to DNA-damaging agents and suggest that the cellular sensitivity and the prolonged repressed RNA synthesis are primarily due to a transcription defect .
4) We recently found that human cells defective in the DNA mismatch repair gene , hMSH2 , were deficient in the transcription-coupled repair ( TCR ) of both oxidative DNA damage , including thymine glycols , and UV-induced DNA damage .
5) To gain insight into the coupling mechanism between transcription and repair , we have set up an in vitro system in which we isolate an elongating RNA pol IIO , which is stalled in front of a cisplatin adduct .
6) Identifying ELL as an essential player for RNA Pol II restart during cellular DNA damage response opens the way to obtaining a mechanistic description of transcription resumption after DNA repair .
7) Mutations in the CSA or CSB complementation genes cause the Cockayne syndrome , a severe genetic disorder that results in patients ' death in early adulthood .
8) We have explored this important question by investigating the function of histone H2B mono-ubiquitylation ( H2Bub ) , a well-characterized epigenetic mark associated with RNA Pol II elongation , in the cellular response to DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation .
9) Two of the hallmarks of Cockayne 's syndrome ( CS ) are the hypersensitivity of cells to UV light and the lack of recovery of the ability to synthesize RNA following exposure of cells to UV light , in spite of the normal repair capacity at the overall genome level .

In which diseases have electronic patient diaries been applied ?
0) The specific aims of this pilot study are to compare the efficacy of diabetic patients documenting their health maintenance data ( i.e. blood glucose levels , meal intake , and exercise ) using an electronic patient diary ( ED ) versus a traditional pen and paper ( PD ) diary ; and determine participants ' satisfaction with each diary approach .
1) In a randomized crossover trial , 24 patients suffering from chronic cancer and non-cancer pain completed both the electronic and the paper version of a pain diary based on the Minimal Documentation System ( MIDOS ) for pain and symptom assessment .
2) The patient diary serves as the primary means used by patients and care providers to monitor and ensure glycemic control among this population and as a key component to effective diabetes management .
3) This study used electronic diaries to examine patterns of mood and physical symptoms within and across days in two independent samples of cancer patients .
4) A handheld electronic diary ( HED ) that can be used throughout the day may provide more useful and accurate information about pain , treatments , and function than available paper and on-line diaries that are designed to be used once daily , weekly or less often .
5) During the field monitoring phase , participants were asked to provide salivary cotinine samples and complete electronic diaries about smoking , smoking urge , ADHD symptoms , and stress in everyday life for two days on ADHD medication and for two days on placebo .
6) They used electronic diaries to record allergy symptoms and medication use during the pollen season .
7) The present study used electronic diaries to examine how parent responses to their child 's pain predict daily adjustment of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) .
8) In recent years regulatory agencies , clinical researchers , and sponsors have widely accepted and utilized changes in `` ON '' and `` OFF '' time measured by Patient Hauser Diaries as endpoints for measuring efficacy of therapeutics seeking approval for symptomatic treatment of PD .
9) Electronic diaries can be used for self-assessment of PD symptoms .
--------------------
Is COL5A2 gene associated to ischemic heart disease ?
0) Null alleles for the COL5A1 gene and missense mutations for COL5A1 or the COL5A2 gene underlie cases of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , characterized by fragile , hyperextensible skin and hypermobile joints .
1) Against the background of a variety of international guidelines and a national disease management program for patients with coronary heart disease , a national health-care guideline for the management of patients with chronic ischemic heart disease ( `` Nationale VersorgungsLeitlinie Chronische KHK [ NVL KHK ] '' ) was first published in Germany in 2006 .
2) Although ARBs protect organs , especially blood vessel , heart , brain and kidney in sites of pharmacology , ARBs are still not much as effective results as ACE inhibitors for the patients with ischemic heart disease , by many clinical trials .
3) In the present review the dates about association of genetic variants of a plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI-1 ) and tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) with ischemic heart disease and atherosclerosis of other localization are toted .
4) And the role of DCD in ischemic heart disease has drawn increasing attention in particular its relationship with insulin secretion and glycemic control , nitric oxide ( NO ) synthesis and hypertension , platelet aggregation and acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) .
5) This study demonstrates that a single common mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene is associated with elevated plasma triglycerides and reduced HDL cholesterol levels , whereby carriers , in particular women , seem to be predisposed to ischemic heart disease .
6) It is often stated that the first signs of an increased risk of ischemic heart disease were noticed in 2004 , however already in 2001 the FDA concluded , based on data available to the EMA at the time of initial approval , that rosiglitazone should not be used in combination with insulin , because this combination therapy was associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure and ischemic heart disease .
7) [ Polymorphic markers Ala455Val of the THBD gene and Arg353Gln of the F7 gene and association with unfavorable outcomes of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with a history of acute ischemic heart disease ] .
8) In this review , we 'll summarize the data relating race and genetics , including ABO blood type , to VTE , ischemic heart disease and postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery .
9) The activity of the pituitary hormones ( ACTH , STH , TTH , FSH , LH ) , the adrenal hormones ( cortisol , aldosterone ) , the kidney hormone ( renin ) , and the thyroid hormones ( thyroxine tri-iodthyronine ) , the thyroxine binding capacity of blood proteins and the activity of the hormones of the pancreas ( insulin ) and the sex glands ( testosterone , estradiol ) were studied in 26 males suffering from ischemic heart disease verified by means of selective coronarography and in 20 healthy males with no atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries of the heart .
--------------------
Does thyroid hormone receptor beta1 affect insulin secretion ?
0) Retinoid acid receptor beta2 ( 3p24 ) , thyroid hormone receptor beta1 ( 3p24 .3 ) , Ras association domain family 1A ( 3p21 .3 ) , and the fragile histidine triad gene ( 3p14 .2 ) have been considered as tumor suppressor genes ( TSGs ) for breast cancers .
1) Thyroid hormone action , widely recognized on cell proliferation and metabolism , has recently been related to the phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) , an upstream regulator of the Akt kinase and the involvement of the thyroid hormone receptor beta1 has been hypothesized .
2) Activated by thyroid hormone , the MAPK ( ERK1/2 ) signaling pathway causes serine phosphorylation by MAPK of several nucleoproteins , including the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor beta1 .
3) Furthermore , the association between thyroid hormone receptor beta1 ( TRbeta1 ) and PI3K-regulatory subunit p85alpha , and the inhibition of T3-induced PI3K activation and mTOR phosphorylation by a dominant negative TR ( G345R ) demonstrated the involvement of TR in this T3 action .
4) Proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta are likely involved in this disease , but are also known to inhibit thyroid hormone receptor ( TR ) - beta1 gene expression , which is of interest as the D1 promoter contains TREs .
5) In CV-1 cells transfected with wild-type ( wt ) nuclear thyroid hormone receptor TRbeta1 ( TR ) , L-thyroxine ( T ( 4 ) ) causes activation and nuclear translocation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK , ERK1/2 ) , co-immunoprecipitation of MAPK and TR , and MAPK-dependent serine phosphorylation of TR .
6) The expression of transcription factors , such as thyroid hormone receptor-beta1 ( TRbeta1 ) , and transcriptional co-repressors , such as histone deactylase 3 ( HDAC3 ) , was affected by Delta9-THC in a dose-dependent manner , whereby 15 microM Delta9-THC caused a 2.8-fold inhibition of TRbeta1 expression , but a 3.5-fold increase in HDAC3 expression .
7) Thyroid hormone receptor-beta ( TR beta 1 ) impairs cell proliferation by the transcriptional inhibition of cyclins D1 , E and A2 .
8) Could this reflect aberrant mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta1 ( TRbeta1 ) heterodimerization with specific TR auxiliary proteins ( TRAPs ) from different tissues , altering the mutant 's ability to transactivate tissue-specific genes ?
9) Transcription regulation assays performed in human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293 cells show that 100 nM T ( 3 ) increases transcription from the MCL-1 promoter twofold in the presence of thyroid hormone receptor beta1 , but not of its alpha1 isoform .

What types of DNA mutations are induced by 2-hydroxy-dATP ( 2-OH-dATP ) ?
0) Induction of mutations by N-acetoxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene modified M13 viral DNA
1) Acetaldehyde is a highly reactive compound that causes various forms of damage to DNA including DNA adducts single and/or double-strand breaks DSBs point mutations sister chromatid exchanges SCEs and DNA-DNA cross-links
2) The results of in vivo genetic interactions with mutations in kinetochore proteins and CEN DNA and of in vitro biochemical assays suggest that Spt4p is important for kinetochore function
3) The metabolism of estradiol can cause DNA damage in two ways a formation of estradiol-adenine guanine adducts which are released from the DNA backbone leaving depurinated sites which undergo error prone DNA repair and mutations and b generation of oxygen free radicals resulting from redox cycling of 4-OH estradiol to the 3-4 estradiol quinone and back conversion to 4-OH estradiol
4) To study the mechanisms of mutagenesis by the carcinogen 1,8-dinitropyrene we have determined the DNA adducts formed and mutations induced by its partially activated metabolite 1-nitroso-8-nitropyrene 1,8-NONP in an Escherichia coli strain deficient in nucleotide excision-repair

8) These results suggest that the oxidative metabolites of 1-nitropyrene induce sequence-specific DNA mutations at the guanine and adenine sites at high frequency
9) 1-Nitropyrene 4,5-oxide and 1-nitropyrene 9,10-oxide are oxidative metabolites that are responsible for the mutagenicity of 1-nitropyrene

Can botulism poisoning of a pregnant woman harm her fetus ?
0) We describe a case of foodborne botulism in an 8-month old infant caused by ingestion of an improperly prepared home-canned homogenized turkey meal representing the youngest fatal case reported in medical literature
1) The only product approved by the FDA for the treatment of photodamage fine wrinkles mottled hyperpigmentation and skin roughness topical tretinoin emollient cream may help prevent additional photoaging when it is used to treat existing photoaging
2) Our recent findings suggest that treatment with the adsorptive column TR350 can be a feasible option for botulism which is a rare but potentially lethal disease
3) Recently we have successfully treated a 64 year old woman with the illness with IMMUSORBA TR350 Asahi Medical Tokyo Japan an extracorporeal adsorptive column containing polyvinylalcohol-tryptophan as an adsorptive agent which has been widely used in Japan to treat myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barre syndrome

What histone trimethylation has been associated to RNA splicing ?
0) Exposure to the widely used herbicide atrazine results in deregulation of global tissue-specific RNA transcription in the third generation and is associated with a global decrease of histone trimethylation in mice
1) Our results provide compelling evidence that trimethylation of lysine residues within histones H3 and H4 is a novel mechanism involved in reducing C9orf72 mRNA expression in expanded repeat carriers
2) Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 EZH2 an important histone-modifying enzyme is able to trimethylate histone 3 on lysine 27 H3K27Me3 consequently leading to gene silencing especially silencing of tumor suppressor genes such as p53
3) Our analyses of mutants that lack the PcG histone methyltransferase HMTase E z or the trxG HMTase Ash1 provide strong evidence that differential histone lysine trimethylation at the promoter and in the coding region confers transcriptional ON and OFF states of Ubx
4) A recurrent glycine-to-arginine/valine alteration at codon 34 G34R/V within H3F3A a gene that encodes the replication-independent histone variant H3 .3 reportedly occurs exclusively in pediatric glioblastomas
5) Moreover treating repeat carrier-derived fibroblasts with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine a DNA and histone demethylating agent not only decreased C9orf72 binding to trimethylated histone residues but also increased C9orf72 mRNA expression
6) Then through siRNA-mediated knock-down tests and protein and chromatin immunoprecipitations we found the TCF4-β-catenin complex can recruit the histone trimethylation complex PRC2 as a co-repressor while binding to the TCF4-binding element TBE in the promoter regions of miR-145 miR-132 and miR-212
7) Collectively these data suggest that menin has an essential role in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling through a mechanism that eventually affects histone trimethylation of the downstream target gene Axin2 and activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibits islet tumor cell proliferation
8) Thus our study shows the significance of a proper balance regulated by histone trimethylation between differential expression of MMPs and their TIMPs for maintaining normal pregnancy and its deregulation as a contributing factor for pathogenesis of invasive disorders during pregnancy

4) Calsequestrin 2 CSQ2 is generally regarded as the primary Ca2 buffering molecule present inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum SR in cardiac cells but findings from CSQ2 knockout experiments raise major questions about its role and necessity
5) These findings identify MCIP1 as a downstream target of 5-HT 2A/2B receptor signaling in cardiac muscle cells and suggest possible uses for 5-HT 2A/2B agonists and antagonists as modulators of cardiac growth and gene expression
6) 5 beta 14 beta-androstane-3 beta 14-diol the steroid nucleus of cardiac glycosides of the digitalis type is the minimum structure for specific receptor recognition and the key structure for inducing protein conformational change and thus Na,K-ATPase inhibition
7) α-Tropomyosin αTm is the predominant tropomyosin isoform in adult human heart and constitutes a major component in Ca regulated systolic contraction of cardiac muscle
8) These findings support the notion that the important kinases ERK2 and CaMKIIδ can alter the passive force of myocytes in the heart although CaMKIIδ appears to be more potent during physiological and pathophysiological states
9) This molecule referred to as pyridine activator of myocyte hypertrophy acts as a selective agonist for 5-HT 2A/2B receptors and induces hypertrophy of cardiac muscle cells through a signaling pathway involving calcineurin and a kinase-dependent mechanism that inactivates class II histone deacetylases which act as repressors of cardiac growth

Which mitochondrial genes are regulated by thyroid hormone ?
0) Thyroid hormone ( TH ) is an important regulator of mitochondrial content and activity .
1) Thyroid hormone and exercise stimulate expression of a nuclear respiratory factor ( NRF ) that induces the nuclear gene TFAM , which encodes the mitochondrial transcription factor A that controls mitochondrial replication and transcription .
2) Thyroid hormone ( TH ) regulates mitochondrial respiratory rate by activating coordinated transcription in the nucleus and mitochondria .
3) These results thus indicate an integrated nuclear-mitochondrial cross talk in regulation of mitochondrial transcription by TH during brain development .
4) However , in-spite of the similarities between neurological disorders caused by perinatal hypothyroidism and those caused by various genetic mitochondrial defects we still do not know as to how thyroid hormone ( TH ) regulates mitochondrial transcription during development and whether this regulation by TH is nuclear mediated or through mitochondrial TH receptors ?
5) These results demonstrate that TH has a major effect on mitochondrial content , regulation and coupling in slow oxidative muscle , but to a lesser extent in fast muscle , due to the high expression of TH receptors and PGC-1alpha transcription factor .
6) Inflammation produces marked changes in lipid metabolism , including increased serum fatty acids ( FAs ) and triglycerides ( TGs ) , increased hepatic TG production and VLDL secretion , increased adipose tissue lipolysis , and decreased FA oxidation in liver and heart .
7) The results also support the notion that ATP synthase beta-subunit is regulated by TH through the indirect activation of GABP/NRF -2 .
8) Nuclear respiratory factors ( NRF ) -1 and GA-binding protein ( BP ) / NRF-2 may function as transacting genes , but regulation of these genes by TH is not demonstrated .
9) A key phenotype associated with type 2 diabetes in humans is impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle , a pattern potentially contributing to increased lipid accumulation and impaired metabolic flexibility-in turn , central features of both insulin resistance and diabetes .

What is the treatment of Riedel disease ( thyroiditis ) ?
0) In 1796 , an English country physician , Edward Jenner , discovered that inoculating mankind with cowpox can protect them from smallpox ( Riedel S , Edward Jenner and the history of smallpox and vaccination .
1) The fibrosclerosing disorders of retroperitoneal fibrosis , sclerosing mediastinitis , sclerosing cholangitis , orbital pseudotumor , and Riedel thyroiditis are seemingly related in a clinical sense because there are well-documented cases of patients with two or more of these conditions and reports of these disorders presenting in family members .
2) Pestiviruses are a genus within the family Flaviviridae that affect cloven-hoofed animals , causing economically important diseases like classical swine fever ( CSF ) and bovine viral diarrhea ( BVD ) .
3) Clinically it is impossible to distinguish between Riedel 's / thyroiditis and other diseases as undifferentiated carcinoma , Hashimoto 's disease etc. .
4) Lesions of the thyroid with infiltrating plasma cells include HT , fibrous variant of HT , plasmacytoma , plasma cell myeloma , Riedel thyroiditis , IgG4 ( immunoglobulin G4 ) - related disease , IMT , and PCG .
5) This new disease entity includes a wide variety of diseases such as Mikulicz disease , autoimmune pancreatitis , Riedel thyroiditis , interstitial nephritis and retroperitoneal fibrosis .
6) The term autoimmune pancreatitis ( AIP ) was first used in Japan in 1995 to describe a newly recognized form of chronic pancreatitis , after the description of Yoshida and colleagues .
7) Recently published International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria for Autoimmune Pancreatitis include Guidelines of the International Association of Pancreatology , classifying AIP into types 1 and 2 , using five cardinal features of AIP , namely imaging of pancreatic parenchyma and duct , serology , other organ involvement , pancreatic histology , and an optional criterion of response to steroid therapy .
8) Although sclerosing mesenteritis is often associated with other idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as retroperitoneal fibrosis , sclerosing cholangitis , Riedel thyroiditis , and orbital pseudotumor , its exact cause is unknown .
9) By considering Barrett , Hayward , Riedel and Ruol 's studies , they maintain that the fundamental factor which causes the development of cardial adenocarcinoma is the gastroesophageal reflux .

Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of facultative heterochromatin ?
0) How post-translational histone modifications regulate DNA utilization constitutes one of the central questions of chromatin biology
1) Mutations in genes that are important in epigenetic regulation by influencing DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications have long been associated with neuronal disorders in humans such as Rett syndrome Huntington 's disease and some forms of mental retardation and recent work has focused on unravelling their mechanisms of action
2) To detect relative accumulations or losses of constitutive post-translational histone modifications in chromatin regions surrounding DNA double-strand breaks DSB we developed a method based on ion microirradiation and correlation of the signal intensities after immunofluorescence detection of the histone modification in question and the DSB marker γ-H2AX
3) Although post-translational histone modifications are believed to have an important role in modulating transcriptional regulation of UVB-induced COX-2 the underlying biochemical mechanisms are completely unknown
4) Our data reveal that variants of the NURF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that recognize post-translational histone modifications are important regulators of primary spermatocyte differentiation in Drosophila
5) Two major mechanisms that cause epigenetic changes are post-translational histone modifications and DNA methylation at cytosine bases within a CpG dinucleotide
6) Epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications such as histone de acetylation histone methylation and histone sumoylation were identified as regulatory mechanisms in controlling aggressive cell activation in vitro and in disease outcome in animal models in vivo
7) For example mapping of open chromatin regions post-translational histone modifications and DNA methylation across a whole genome is now feasible and new non-coding regulatory RNAs can be sensitively identified via RNA sequencing
8) Deregulation of key epigenetic factors and chromatin-modifying proteins particularly those responsible for the addition removal or recognition of post-translational histone modifications are frequently found in human pancreatic cancer and hence constitute particularly exciting treatment opportunities
9) Two major mechanisms that foster epigenetic changes are DNA methylation at cytosine bases within a CpG dinucleotide and post-translational histone modifications

Which cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor is regulated by Bmi-1 ?
0) Cyclins cyclin-dependent kinases CDKs and the CDK inhibitor p27 kip1 are known to be involved in the regulation of G 1 S phase transition by estrogen in the rodent endometrium
1) Expression of cyclin dependent kinase Cdk inhibitor p27 Kip1 which blocks cell cycle progression from G 1 to S phase can be regulated via multiple mechanisms including transcription protein degradation and translation
2) The Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CYC202 R-roscovitine inhibits retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation causes loss of Cyclin D1 and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway

4) Energy balance and the AKT pathway are important in colorectal cancer development and regulate p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1B CDKN1B/KIP1 which plays a role in preventing cell cycle progression
5) The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 CIP1/WAF1 and p16 INK4a govern the G 1 S cell cycle checkpoint and are essential for determining whether a cell enters into an arrested state
6) GAT-1 deficiency promotes T cell division and survival by down-regulating cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27 kip1 differentially regulating the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 Bcl-xl and Bad and activating transcription factor NF-kappaB through induction of translocation and phosphorylation of protein kinase C PKC theta
7) We show that cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf1/cip1 that inhibits cell proliferation is down-regulated in conjunction with up-regulation of c-fos in the lymphocytes of patients with RA
8) Disruption of Suv4-20h1 expression induced Garrest in the cell cycle and increased expression levels of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A p21 an essential cell cycle protein involved in checkpoint regulation
9) Costimulation through ICAM-1 also had an effect similar to costimulation through CD28 in its ability to down-regulate the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1

0) To analyze RNA synthesis and nucleotidylylation of VPg by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp recombinant RdRp and VPg were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tagged forms
1) Directly acting antiviral DAA agents which inhibit HCV replication are in phase 1 2 and 3 trials these include reagents that target the nonstructural NS 3 protease the NS5A protein the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase NS5B as well as compounds that directly inhibit HCV replication through interaction with host cell proteins
2) For example how the non-structural protein 5 NS5 performs replication and in particular whether the N-terminal methytransferase MTase domain is essential for the function of the C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp remains unclear
3) First we summarize the recent structural and functional advances on the molecules involved in filovirus replication/transcription cycle particularly the NP VP30 VP35 proteins and the large protein L which harbors the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp and mRNA capping activities
4) To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference RNAi as a strategy against TGEV infection two shRNA-expressing plasmids pEGFP-U6 P1 and pEGFP-U6 P2 targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp gene of TGEV were constructed and transfected into swine testicular ST cells

List proteins of lipids droplets
0) The coexistence of lipid droplets together with proteins in the nascent precursor yolk platelets observed in B. arenarum is similar to that found in B. marinus
1) The results clearly show that nHA does not affect the cell viability the lipids droplets formation triglyceride TG synthesis and the expression of adipogenic marker genes/proteins of hMSCs at concentrations lower than 50 μg mL
2) Peptide hormones LH/hCG and ACTH regulate lipoproteins metabolism in their target tissues by increasing LDL receptors number a way which allow more cholesterol to enter the cell
3) Lipids droplets modified coat globules were delivered into acid phosphatase-positive endosomes and lysosomes
4) The adipogenic differentiation potential of hMSCs was examined by analyzing the formation and accumulation of lipids droplets triglyceride TG content and the expression of adipogenic marker genes/proteins
5) Mice Leydig cells after treatment with 200mg/kg of DEC for 12 days showed numerous lipid droplets degenerated mitochondria residual bodies and several giant whorl-like smooth endoplasmic reticulum some of them encircling large lipids droplets
6) Lipoprotein-cholesterol enters the cell by a specific pathway binding of lipoproteins particularly LDL to a membrane specific receptor and internalization of the complex receptor-lipoprotein followed by dissociation of the complex the receptor is reutilized while LDL is hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes in amino-acids and free cholesterol
7) Their salient features such as globular surface coat structures of the endocytic pathway and related cell organelles closely resemble those of the calf goat and sheep
8) Modified Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium DMEM F12 containing 17 microM pantothenic acid 33 microM biotin 100 microM ascorbic acid 1 microM octanoic acid 50 nM triiodothyronine 10 microg/ml insulin 10 newborn calf serum NCS 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 microg/ml streptomycin was used as a basal culture medium which did not contain any synthetic compounds usually used to promote adipogenesis such as indomethacin dexamethasone or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR gamma agonists

--------------------
Is Calcium homeostasis important in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology ?
0) Both RyR2 and calsequestrin are important participants in the cardiac cellular calcium homeostasis
1) The concept that sex hormones may regulate intracellular calcium at the level of the cardiomyocyte is important as levels of these hormones decline in both men and women as the incidence of cardiovascular disease rises
2) Disorders of distal nephron function such as Gitelman 's syndrome nephrolithiasis and adaptation to diuretic drug administration emphasize the importance of this relatively short nephron segment to human physiology
3) This calcium-activated monovalent selective cation channel also plays a key role in cardiovascular pathophysiology for example a mutation in the TRPM4 channel leads to cardiac conduction disease
4) Epigenetic modification has emerged in recent years as a major influence cardiac physiology and histone acetyl transferases HATs and histone deacetylases HDACs are now known to both induce and antagonize hypertrophic growth
5) Calcium is involved in many facets of neuronal physiology including activity growth and differentiation synaptic plasticity and learning and memory as well as pathophysiology including necrosis apoptosis and degeneration
6) In the cardiovascular system T-type calcium channels play an important role for the intracellular calcium homeostasis and spontaneous pacemaker activity and are involved in the progression of structural heart diseases
7) This allows the receptor to play diverse and crucial roles in human physiology and pathophysiology both in calcium homeostasis and in tissues and biological processes unrelated to calcium balance
8) Recent evidence suggests that this arises from sex differences in components of the cardiac excitation-contraction coupling pathway the sequence of events linking myocyte depolarization to calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent contraction
9) Sphingolipids the enigmatic lipid class biochemistry physiology and pathophysiology
--------------------
Do proton pump inhibitors affect thyroxine absorption ?
0) Proton pump inhibitors PPIs in general may alter the absorption of drugs by increasing the intragastric pH. Due to the presence of an imidazole ring the PPIs of the class of substituted benzimidazole sulfoxides may interfere with the metabolism of other drugs by altering the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system via either induction or inhibition
1) For over a decade despite animal and human studies and numerous case reports that demonstrated interference by proton pump inhibitors PPIs with enteric absorption of dietary and medicinal iron the importance of this effect in clinical practice has remained uncertain 1 2
2) Potential areas of concern that have been raised in the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors which could alter this risk-benefit ratio include gastric carcinoid formation the development of rebound acid hypersecretion when proton pump inhibitor treatment is stopped the development of tolerance increased oxyntic gastritis in H. pylori patients and the possibility of increasing the risk of gastric cancer the possible stimulation of growth of non-gastric tumours due to hypergastrinaemia and the possible effect of the hypo/achlorhydria on nutrient absorption particularly iron and vitamin B12
3) While proton pump inhibitors appear to have some direct effect on H. pylori and extreme hypochlorhydria has a deleterious effect on the organism the most likely mechanism by which antisecretory drugs as a class provide this effect is by improving the efficacy of the antibiotics themselves
4) In order to achieve more potent rapid and sustained acid inhibition several compounds are currently under development such as new proton pump inhibitors with a prolonged plasma half-life potassium competitive ATPase blockers PCABs histamine H3 agonists and gastrin antagonists
5) Proton pump inhibitors also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux or with the cytochrome P450 CYP enzyme system e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance
6) The authors propose that PPIs such as omeprazole may interfere with iron absorption in certain patients and that a subpopulation of patients who develop significant iron deficiency characterized by low serum ferritin levels while on PPIs may also develop RLS-like symptoms including RLSAP
7) The absorption of some compounds e.g. benzylpenicillin penicillin G are altered during treatment with proton pump inhibitors as a result of the increased intragastric pH. A synergy has been confirmed between omeprazole and amoxicillin or clarithromycin in the antibacterial effect against Helicobacter pylori
8) H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors can influence the pharmacokinetic profiles of other commonly administered medications by elevating intragastric pH which can alter drug absorption and by interacting with the cytochrome P CYP 450 enzyme system which can affect drug metabolism and clearance
9) The purpose of this study was to examine whether treatment with proton pump inhibitors PPIs can decrease iron absorption in patients with CDA I. Eight CDA I patients 4 boys aged 12-18 years with mild iron overload not yet requiring chelating therapy received 20 mg/d omeprazole for 6 months
--------------------
Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome ?
0) We have identified a novel nonsense mutation in codon 449 in the 3 end of exon 10 in the TR beta gene in a 16-year-old male patient with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone who also had familial thyroxine binding globulin deficiency
1) The thyroid hormone resistance syndrome diabetes obesity and some types of cancer are just a few examples of important diseases that are related to TR malfunctioning particularly impaired hormone binding
2) Mutations in the thyroid hormone TH binding region of the TH beta-receptor TRbeta that eliminate its TH-binding ability lead to the thyroid hormone resistance syndrome RTH in humans which is characterized by high blood TH levels goiter hyperactivity and tachycardia
3) These findings suggested that DNA-binding and receptor dimerization are important for dominant negative inhibition by the mutant TR which is responsible for thyroid hormone resistance in a heterozygous patient with a point mutation in the TR beta gene
4) Resistance to thyroid hormone RTH is a rare disorder characterized by variable tissue hyporesponsiveness to thyroid hormone usually caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta TRbeta
5) These findings indicate that mutant beta receptors in patients with thyroid hormone resistance have reduced affinity for T3 and are functionally deficient but impair the activity of normal receptors thereby providing a mechanism for the dominant mode of inheritance in this disorder
6) The cause of the disease is the mutation in TR-beta receptor gene
7) We have identified 20 different mutations in the thyroid hormone beta-receptor TR beta gene in RTH and assayed mutant receptor properties using the TSH alpha subunit gene promoter or promoters containing three different types of positive thyroid response element TRE
8) A novel mutation of thyroid hormone receptor beta I431V impairs corepressor release and induces thyroid hormone resistance syndrome
9) We report here that RTH receptors interact aberrantly with a newly recognized family of transcriptional corepressors variously denoted as nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR retinoid X receptor interacting protein-13 RIP-13 silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors SMRT and thyroid hormone receptor-associating cofactor TRAC

1) These results collectively suggest that ASP5736 is a novel and potent 5-HT5A receptor antagonist that not only ameliorates positive-like symptoms but also cognitive impairments in animal models of schizophrenia , without adverse effects .
2) Programmed death 1 ( PD-1 ) is a T cell co-inhibitory receptor with two ligands , PD-L1 and PD-L2 .
3) The `` core '' region of the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) , a central clock responsible for coordinating circadian rhythms , shows a daily rhythm in phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase ( pERK ) .
4) The Monascus fermentation product red mold rice ( RMR ) has been found to contain the cholesterol-lowering agent monacolin K ( MK ) in both its lactone ( MKL ) and acid ( MKA ) forms and the mycotoxin citrinin ( CT ) .
5) Excitatory amino acid receptors , especially N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors , have been considered to play an important role in the transmission of light information from the retina to the circadian clocks in the SCN .
6) To investigate the feasibility and significance of modified Killian ( MK ) method in the clinical diagnosis of congenital pyriform sinus fistula ( CPSF ) by electronic laryngoscopy.The following examinations were performed for 30 suspected cases of CPSF , including the traditional electronic laryngoscopy , MK examination ( modified Killian position + head rotation + the Valsalva maneuver ) , barium swallow X-ray ( BSX ) and CT , and a prospective comparison among them were done .
7) The introduction of the EMI Mk I computerized axial tomography ( CAT ) unit revolutionized imaging by providing electronic trans-axial images of the brain that allowed clear separation of various tissues with very similar attenuation coefficients .
8) We recently identified ASP5736 , ( N - ( diaminomethylene ) -1 - ( 3,5-difluoropyridin-4-yl ) -4 - fluoroisoquinoline-7-carboxamide ( 2E ) - but-2-enedioate ) , a novel antagonist of 5-HT5A receptor , and here describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization of this compound .
9) The 5-HT2 +6 +7 antagonist metergoline in combination with the 5-HT1A +2 +7 antagonist methysergide inhibited the stimulatory effect of 5-CT on both hormones , whereas the 5-HT1A +1 B antagonist cyanopindolol only inhibited the oxytocin response .
--------------------
From which sequence does the Alu repeat originate from ?
0) The slightly longer 3 end of the psiHLAO2 transcript shows that the Alu repeat is followed by an 11-bp poly A tract that in turn is followed by an AT-rich 81 sequence of 105bp
1) This Alu repeat is a member of the human specific-1 HS-1 subfamily although one of the five diagnostic nucleotides is a cattarhine specific CS subfamily mutation suggesting that it may represent an intermediate form in the evolution between these two subfamilies
2) The analysis of the Alu sequences and their flanking direct repeat sequences suggest that an ancestral genomic structure has been maintained in the GPA gene whereas the GPB gene has arisen from the acquisition of 3 sequences different from those of the GPA gene by homologous recombination at the Alu repeats during or after gene duplication
3) This suggests that a recombination event took place here and that an Alu repeat sequence that is known to have characteristics of transposable elements played some role in a recombination or gene conversion event
4) The conservation of this novel arrangement among the higher primates suggests that an inserted Alu family repeat and its flanking genomic sequence have co-evolved for at least 30 million years to provide the canonical CCAAT and TATA promoter elements of the theta 1 globin genes in higher primates
5) Based on the finding from bioinformatic analysis that Alu repeats represent 85 of LDLR intronic sequences outside exon-intron junctions we designed a strategy to improve the exploration of genomic regions in the vicinity of exons in 110 FH subjects from an admixed population
6) With a probe containing Alu repeat sequences Pääbo isolated a 3.4-kilobase DNA fragment from a 2,400-year-old Egyptian mummy which was subsequently shown to contain an intron of the nuclear gene HLA-DQA ref
7) An Alu repeat sequence was identified in the first intron of the human D4 gene but is not present in the rat D4 gene
8) piBLUR clones are able to retrieve human clones from such libraries because at least one Alu family repeat is present on most 15 to 20 kb fragments of human DNA and because of the relative species-specificity of the sequences comprising the Alu family
9) The most 3 splice donor site of exon 1A is found within an Alu repeat sequence
--------------------
How is mTORC1 involved in the regulation of heat stress ?
0) Together these findings define a novel molecular mechanism whereby heat stress induces PI3K/mTORC2-dependent AKT survival signaling in HCC cells and provide a mechanistic rationale for adjuvant AKT inhibition in combination with thermal ablation as a strategy to enhance HCC cell killing and prevent local recurrence particularly at the ablation margin
1) HSF-1 is involved in regulation of ascaroside pheromone biosynthesis by heat stress in Caenorhabditis elegans
2) OsHIRP1 is an E3 ligase that acts as a positive regulator in the plant response to heat stress thus providing important information relating to adaptation and regulation under heat stress in plant
3) These results show that in MDCK cells preconditioning heat stress-induced HSPs are not involved in the regulation of Na K Cl and Na P i cotransporters and do not protect them from modulation by severe heat stress
4) Exposure to sublethal heat stress activates a complex cascade of signaling events such as activators NO signal molecules PKCε and mediators HSP70 and COX-2 leading to implementation of heat preconditioning an adaptive mechanism which makes the organism more tolerant to additional stress
5) Here we report that the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR regulates the diffusion of Xrn2 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm facilitating the degradation of iMet under conditions of heat stress
6) By screening the profiling data for genes in biochemical pathways in which known HSF targets were involved we discovered that at each step in the pathway leading to osmolytes the expression of genes is regulated by heat stress and in several cases by HSF
7) In summary these results support the novel concept that heat stress inhibits the Akt pathway by dissociating PDK-1 from its chaperone Hsp90 leading to potentiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in resistant malignant cells
8) Therefore this work provides evidence indicating that Tpk2 and Tpk3 have opposing roles in translational adaptation during heat stress and highlight how the same signaling pathway can be regulated to generate strikingly distinct physiological outputs
9) Abscisic acid ABA is known to play roles in regulating plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses but whether ABA 's effects on heat tolerance are associated with its regulation of heat stress transcription factors HSFs and heat shock proteins HSPs is not well documented

Which myosin isozymes are located within the pericuticular necklace of the hair cell ?
0) Type B cells the predominant hair cell type in the utricular macula are small cells with short sterocilia and kinocilia 2-6 times as long as their longest stereocilia
1) Silvery hair is a common presentation of rare group of autosomal recessive disorders called Silvery hair syndromes including Griscelli syndrome GS Chediak-Higashi syndrome and Elejalde syndrome
2) Using immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation experiments we showed in bullfrog sacculus that PMCA1b is the major isozyme of hair cell and supporting cell basolateral membranes and that PMCA2a is the only PMCA present in hair bundles
3) Root hair a special type of tubular-shaped cell outgrows from the root epidermal cell and plays important roles in the acquisition of nutrients and water as well as interactions with biotic and abiotic stresses
4) Recent work has demonstrated the presence of several myosin isozymes in hair bundles confirmed that bundles display myosin ATPase activity and shown that the work performed by myosin molecules could account for one aspect of the amplificatory process
5) Linearizing the nullclines and assuming perfect time-scale separation between the variables we can map the FitzHugh-Nagumo system to a simple two-state model in which each of the states corresponds to the two possible values of the binary-filtered hair bundle trajectory

9) We show that ELMOD1 is a GTPase-activating protein in hair cells for the small GTP-binding protein ARF6 known to participate in actin assembly and membrane trafficking
--------------------
Are nucleosomes positioned at DNA replication origins ?
0) Together our data provide a comprehensive genome-wide view of chromatin structure at replication origins and suggest a model of nucleosome positioning at replication origins in which the underlying sequence occludes nucleosomes to permit binding of the origin recognition complex which then likely in concert with nucleosome modifiers and remodelers positions nucleosomes adjacent to the origin to promote replication origin function
1) The availability of genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions has led to an explosion of information about how nucleosomes are assembled at transcription start sites but no similar maps exist for DNA replication origins
2) The EcoRI CIV DNA fragment M 7.1 kb 0.310-0 .345 map units harbors one out of at least six loci of DNA replication origins which is located at nucleotide position 485-513
3) On average replication origins contain a nucleosome depleted region centered next to the ACS element flanked on both sides by arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes
4) Here we combine high-resolution genome-wide nucleosome maps with comprehensive annotations of DNA replication origins to identify patterns of nucleosome occupancy at eukaryotic replication origins
5) Using lambda DNA we show that DNA replication origins are activated in clusters in regions that contain closely spaced adenine or thymine asymmetric tracks used as preferential initiation sites
6) B19V replication follows a model of rolling hairpin-dependent DNA replication in which the large nonstructural protein NS1 introduces a site-specific single-strand nick in the viral DNA replication origins which locate at the ITRs
7) The DNA replication origins of metazoan genomes are the sites of complex sequence-specific protein-DNA interactions determining their precise cycle of activation and deactivation once only along each cell cycle
8) Data obtained show that antiviral activities of bis-linked netropsin derivatives are targeted by specific complexes formed by helicase UL9 of herpes simplex virus type 1 with viral DNA replication origins represented by two OriS sites and one OriL site
9) Using deleted derivatives of cloned amplicons we mapped one of the viral DNA replication origins ori-2 or oriL at coordinate 0.422 of the standard HSV-1 genome and at an equivalent position within the HSV-2 genome
--------------------
Name five programs for transcript quantification from RNASeq experiments
0) By combining differential measurements with resolving power to detect DEGs the LSTNR method offers an alternative approach to interrogate noisy and low-replication RNAseq datasets which handles multiple biological conditions at once and defines benchmarks to validate RNAseq experiments with standard benchtop assays
1) To study larval performance and transcriptomic responses to host and non-host plants we conducted developmental assays and replicated RNAseq experiments with Manduca larvae fed on different Solanaceous plants as well as on a Brassicaceous non-host plant Brassica napus
2) RNAseq experiments allowed the identification of 170 differentially expressed genes including known Wnt catenin target genes such as Notum Axin2 and Lef1 as well as novel potential candidates Fam84a Stk32a and Itga9
3) Then we identify candidate genes involved intrypanosome susceptibility by taking advantage of genomic resources from a closely related species We compiled a comprehensive transcript library from 72 published and unpublished RNAseq experiments of trypanosome infected and uninfected flies and improved the currenttranscriptome assembly
4) Closed breeding populations in the dog in conjunction with advances in gene mapping and sequencing techniques facilitate mapping of autosomal recessive diseases and identification of novel disease-causing variants often using unorthodox experimental designs
5) To this aim we quantified the expression levels of total mRNAs from sorted alpha and beta cells of low-fat and high-fat diet-treated mice through RNAseq experiments using a transgenic mouse strain allowing collections of pancreatic alpha and beta-cells after 16 weeks of diet
6) To life scientists one important feature offered by RNAseq a next-generation sequencing tool used to estimate changes in gene expression levels lies in its unprecedented resolution
7) Subsequent RNAseq experiments one employing nac7 RNAi leaves and the other using leaf protoplasts overexpressing Nac7 revealed an important role for NAC7 in regulating genes in photosynthesis chlorophyll degradation and protein turnover pathways that each contribute to the functional stay-green phenotype
8) Evidence of cryptic splicing resulting in novel exon transcription as a consequence of the inversion in ADAMTS17 is identified through RNAseq experiments
9) In RNAseq experiments of human induced pluripotent stem cell iPSC derived cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin both PLCE1 and ATP2B1 displayed anthracycline-dependent gene expression profiles

Which thyroid hormone transporter is implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome ?
0) Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome own experiences
1) The thyroid hormone resistance syndrome diabetes obesity and some types of cancer are just a few examples of important diseases that are related to TR malfunctioning particularly impaired hormone binding
2) We have identified a novel nonsense mutation in codon 449 in the 3 end of exon 10 in the TR beta gene in a 16-year-old male patient with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone who also had familial thyroxine binding globulin deficiency
3) Resistance to thyroid hormone RTH is a rare disorder characterized by variable tissue hyporesponsiveness to thyroid hormone usually caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta TRbeta
4) Mutations in the thyroid hormone TH binding region of the TH beta-receptor TRbeta that eliminate its TH-binding ability lead to the thyroid hormone resistance syndrome RTH in humans which is characterized by high blood TH levels goiter hyperactivity and tachycardia
5) These findings suggested that DNA-binding and receptor dimerization are important for dominant negative inhibition by the mutant TR which is responsible for thyroid hormone resistance in a heterozygous patient with a point mutation in the TR beta gene
6) From the early diagnostic approaches centered on the assessment of thyroid function either by in vivo radioisotopic techniques or by in vitro radioimmunological measurement of hormone plasma concentrations it is nowadays possible to precisely define the molecular events triggered by the iodothyronine signal at the level of target tissues
7) Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome is characterized by a reduced target tissue response to the action of thyroid hormone which leads to high levels of free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine with non-suppressed levels of thyrotropin TSH
8) We report here that RTH receptors interact aberrantly with a newly recognized family of transcriptional corepressors variously denoted as nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR retinoid X receptor interacting protein-13 RIP-13 silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors SMRT and thyroid hormone receptor-associating cofactor TRAC
9) Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome also known as Refetoff syndrome is a rare disease associated with decreased reaction of body tissues to thyroid hormones TH

What are the Topological Domains ( TADs ) ?
0) Defining chromatin interaction frequencies and topological domains is a great challenge for the annotations of genome structures .
1) Identifying topological domains is now an important step toward understanding the structure and functions of spatial genome organization .
2) Topoisomerase II activity involved in cleaving DNA into topological domains is altered in a multiple drug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line .
3) Chinese hamster ovary SMR16 cells are apparently resistant to topoisomerase II poisons because the topoisomerase II that defines the DNA topological domains is either decreased in amount or insensitive to drug action .

5) YY146 , an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody , was employed as a targeting molecule to which we conjugated the zwitterionic near-infrared fluorescence ( NIRF ) dye ZW800-1 and the chelator deferoxamine ( Df ) .
6) Pretreatment of neutrophils with a monoclonal antibody to CD18 , β chain of lymphocyte function-associated molecule 1 ( LFA-1 ) , or an Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor before incubation with the highly leukotoxic strain inhibited the release of resistin .
7) Although daratumumab , a CD38 monoclonal antibody , has established its efficacy as a single agent and in combination with immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors , elotuzumab ( signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 monoclonal antibody ) has proven activity in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone .
8) Strategies aimed at reducing tumor necrosis factor in patients with Crohn 's disease include the mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody infliximab , the humanized monoclonal antibody CDP571 , the human recombinant tumor necrosis factor receptor fusion protein etanercept , and the small molecule thalidomide .
9) Alemtuzumab , a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the surface molecule CD52 , leads to a rapid depletion of immune cells in the innate and adaptive immune system .

--------------------
Which are the main histone modifications associated with enhancers ?
0) The coexistence of high mono-methylation and low tri-methylation levels of lysine 4 of histone H3 is considered a signature of enhancers but a comprehensive view of histone modifications associated to enhancers is still lacking
1) Features that are associated with enhancer activity such as regulatory factor binding or histone modifications can predict the location of enhancers
2) Based on ChIP-seq analysis of enhancer-associated histone modifications including H3K4 methylation and H3K9 acetylation we discovered several potential enhancers for one of which was located 16kb upstream of the gene 's transcriptional start site
3) The organization of the genome into functional units such as enhancers and active or repressed promoters is associated with distinct patterns of DNA and histone modifications
4) Formation of nucleosome free region NFR accompanied by specific histone modifications at flanking nucleosomes is an important prerequisite for enhancer and promoter activity
5) We show further that the ability of YY1 to regulate CPC phenotype is associated with its ability to modulate histone modifications specifically at a developmentally critical enhancer of Nkx2-5 and other key cardiac transcription factor such as Tbx5
6) Thanks to the recent technological advances to map histone modifications and chromatin-associated factors genome-wide several studies have begun to characterize chromatin signatures of active enhancers
7) Using PARE on ChIP-seq histone modifications from four ENCODE cell lines and four hematopoietic differentiation stages we identified several enhancers whose regulatory activity is stage specific and correlates positively with the expression of proximal genes in a particular stage
8) These results indicate that AHR recruitment to the promoter is not sufficient to induce the histone modifications needed to activate gene expression and show that there is a good correlation between the regulatory chromatin changes associated with ligand-induced AHR target gene transcription and the resultant toxicity of the ligand
9) Selection was based on three criteria associated with enhancer regions 1 H3K4me1 and H3K27ac histone modifications 2 DNase I hypersensitivity of chromatin and 3 inter-species conservation
--------------------
What is the enzymatic activity of the breast cancer associated gene BRCA1 ?
0) The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is an important genetic factor in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and there is increasing evidence of an important role for BRCA1 in the sporadic forms of both cancer types .
1) The recent cloning of a breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA1 ) , and determination of the locus of a related gene ( BRCA2 ) , offers potential for clinical genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility .
2) The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 , is a nuclear phosphoprotein which functions as a tumor suppressor in human breast cancer cells .
3) Clinical studies suggest that the mRNA expression level of excision repair cross complementing group 1 gene ( ERCC1 ) is associated with epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation and breast cancer susceptibility 1 gene ( BRCA1 ) mRNA expression in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .
4) Breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA1 ) is a nuclear phosphoprotein expressed in many nuclear processes , including stem cell regulator , DNA damage repair , recombination , transcription , ubiquitination , cell cycle checkpoint enforcement , and centrosome regulation .
5) These findings indicate that HOXA9 restricts breast tumor aggression by modulating expression of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 , which we believe provides an explanation for the loss of BRCA1 expression in sporadic breast tumors in the absence of BRCA1 genetic modifications .
6) Some of the genes that encode the kinases and ubiquitin ligases in this pathway are cancer predisposition genes , most prominently the breast cancer predisposition gene BRCA1 , which encodes a ubiquitin ligase .
7) A breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene , BRCA1 , which is responsible for disease in approximately 45 % of breast cancer families and most families that contain breast and ovarian cancer , has been assigned by genetic linkage to 17q12-21 .
8) Because BARD1 associates via its NH2-terminal RING domain with the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 that provides a platform for interactions with proteins involved in DNA repair and checkpoint control , our results provide a link between the Ewing 's sarcoma gene product and the genome surveillance complex .
9) We now report that BRCA1 stimulates the base excision repair pathway , a major mechanism for the repair of oxidized DNA , by stimulating the activity of key base excision repair ( BER ) enzymes , including 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase ( OGG1 ) , the DNA glycosylase NTH1 , and the apurinic endonuclease redox factor 1/apurinic endonuclease 1 ( REF1/APE1 ) , in human breast carcinoma cells .

Is there any link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B ?
0) After Raf and Mos Tpl-2 is the third serine/threonine oncoprotein kinase that has been shown to function as a direct activator of MEK-1
1) Members of the Aurora Polo and cyclin-dependent Cdk kinase families are known to regulate multiple events throughout cell division whereas another kinase citron kinase CIT-K for a long time has been considered to function solely during cytokinesis the last phase of cell division
2) Here we studied the effects of the pan-aurora kinase inhibitor tozasertib VX680 MK-0457 and the aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib MLN8237 that shows some specificity for aurora kinase A over aurora kinase B in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines with acquired drug resistance
3) To elucidate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs and Akt kinase in leukemogenesis caused by the breakpoint cluster region BCR Abelson ABL tyrosine kinase oncoprotein we examined the activities of MAPKs and Akt kinase and their roles in the action of STI571 a specific inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia CML cells
4) A key step in the activation of NF-kappaB is the phosphorylation of its inhibitor IkappaB alpha by a ubiquitination-inducible multiprotein kinase complex IkappaB alpha kinase
5) Recent studies show that flavonoids can bind directly to some protein kinases including Akt/protein kinase B Akt/PKB Fyn Janus kinase 1 JAK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 MEK1 phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase kinase 4 MKK4 Raf1 and zeta chain-associated 70-kDa protein ZAP-70 kinase and then alter their phosphorylation state to regulate multiple cell signaling pathways in carcinogenesis processes
6) New tyrosine kinase inhibitors include BCR-ABL kinase selective inhibitors dual ABL/SRC kinase inhibitors and aurora kinase inhibitors
7) Although most p53 protein kinases form p53-activating signals there are few kinases whose action can contribute to the inhibition of p53 as Casein kinase 1 CK1 and Checkpoint kinase 1 CHK1
8) Taken together the results provide initial evidence that kinase FA/GSK -3 alpha represents a newly described heat stress-inducible protein subjected to tyrosine phosphorylation/activation representing a new mode of signal transduction for the regulation of this human carcinoma dedifferentiation modulator and a new mode of heat induction on cascade activation of a protein kinase
9) A number of proteins including cell cycle regulators cyclin dependent kinase 1 cyclin dependent kinase 2 and cyclin dependent kinase 3 MAPK pathway components Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and Extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 interferon regulators tyrosine kinase-2 GTPase regulators Ras-Rasb interactor 1 and controllers of protein tyrosine phosphorylation dual specificity tyrosine Y phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A were common to all genotypes

Is insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) able to affect tendon protein synthesis in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients ?
0) Insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) and IGF-II have powerful , well defined effects on osteoblastic cells , stimulating their proliferation and inducing collagen synthesis , but the role of IGF-I and - II in modulating osteoclast differentiation and activity remains unclear .
1) The relationship between insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) , a hormone which has potent metabolic effects and stimulates protein synthesis , and prolactin and oestradiol was examined to investigate a possible mechanism for the luteal cell hypertrophy that is responsible for the increase in size of the corpus luteum .
2) In animals insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) stimulates collagen production by fibroblasts and is expressed in tendons together with its binding protein 4 ( IGFBP-4 ) .
3) Earlier studies indicate that parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) enhances insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) synthesis in primary osteoblast-enriched fetal rat cell cultures and the stimulatory effect of PTH on bone collagen synthesis is mediated at least in part by IGF-I .
4) We have found that insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) , potent stimulator of collagen biosynthesis , induces prolidase activity in cultured human skin fibroblasts .
5) Insulin-like growth factor-I and - II ( IGF-I and IGF-II ) and/or the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IGF-IR ) have been implicated in a number of human tumors including breast cancer .
6) To elucidate a possible role for insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) in these events , porcine endometrial ( Days 8 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , and 30 ) and conceptus ( Days 12 , 14 , and 16 ) tissues were characterized for the presence of IGF-I peptide and mRNAs .
7) However , recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I ( rhIGF-I ) has now become commercially available as a therapeutic option to treat children of short stature caused by severe primary IGF-I deficiency , defined as : height standard deviation score ( SDS ) less than or equal to -3.0 , basal IGF-I SDS less than or equal to -3.0 , and normal or elevated levels of GH .
8) Parathyroid hormone-related peptide ( PTHrP ) and insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) are both involved in the regulation of bone and cartilage metabolisms and their interaction has been reported in osteoblasts .
9) IGF-I is an important stimulant of protein synthesis in muscle , but it also stimulates free fatty acid use .

To what extent does HPV vaccination reduce the risk for cervical cancer ?
0) Since human papillomavirus HPV infection is the main risk factor for cervical cancer HPV vaccination is considered a promising strategy to prevent cervical cancer
1) We suggest that the recent introduction of voluntary HPV vaccination for girls in North America and elsewhere constitutes a form of neomedicalization Batt Lippman 2010 that links risks for future disease cervical cancer with the transmission of a common sexually transmitted infection HPV
2) As in other countries the HPV vaccination can be a cost-utility strategy to reduce the high burdens of cervical cancer in Peru a rapid and cheap HPV molecular sub-typification is rapidly required
3) The high burden of cervical cancer and the high efficacy and safety of HPV vaccination justify its introduction in the Indian NIP at the earliest possibility to substantially reduce the cervical cancer burden in future
4) As Black Hispanic and Asian populations continue to grow in the US over the next 40 y it is imperative that we not only improve HPV vaccination rates overall but focus on high-risk populations to prevent an increase in cervical cancer disparities
5) Governments of LMICs need enough convincing evidence that HPV vaccination will be more cost-effective in reducing the scourge of cervical cancer
6) The most common reasons for not accepting HPV vaccination were My daughter is too young to have risk of cervical cancer 30.95 The vaccine has not been widely used and the decision will be made after it is widely used 24.91 Worry about the safety of the vaccine 22.85
7) Targeting human papillomavirus HPV by prophylactic HPV vaccination in young adolescent girls and HPV-based screening in mid-adult women offers the most cost-effective strategy to reduce cervical cancer burden worldwide and mitigate the health disparities in cervical cancer burden between low-resourced and high-resourced settings
8) In this review we address five key myths HPV vaccination is not effective at preventing cancer Pap smears are sufficient to prevent cervical cancer HPV vaccination is not safe HPV vaccination is not needed since most infections are naturally cleared by the immune system 11-12 years of age is too young to vaccinate
9) Despite its efficacy in preventing cervical cancer HPV vaccination in females 49.5 and males 37.5 ages 13 through 17 falls well below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's CDC Healthy People 2020 target of 80 coverage

What is the role of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone in the treatment of comatose patients ?
0) Thyrotropin TSH releasing hormone TRH also known as thyroliberin was the first of a number of peptides exerting several roles as a hormone and as a neuropeptide
1) The maternal administration of betamethasone and thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH to accelerate the maturation of the fetus is an increasingly adopted strategy to prevent neonatal morbidity in preterm infants
2) Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone TRH pyroGlu-His-Pro-NH2 is important in the regulation of adenohypophyseal hormone secretion and also serves neurotropic functions in extra-hypothalamic brain areas indicating that it is involved in neurotransmission and other forms of cellular communication
3) The day after admission when methadone treatment was begun the PRL and TSH pituitary response to thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH 200 micrograms i.v. in 12 patients was studied
4) The role of thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH in the dorsal vagal complex DVC in mediating the enhanced gastric contractility induced by glutamate 100 pmol microinjected into the raphe pallidus Rpa was investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats acutely implanted with miniature strain gauge force transducers on the corpus of the stomach
5) Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH is primarily known as the central regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid HPT axis
6) Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH and its analogues have been shown to depolarise motoneurons and stimulate cyclical motor activities such as respiration and locomotion
7) Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH causes hyperthermia in mice which is potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants nortriptyline imipramine clomipramine amitriptyline the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine and various other antidepressants maprotiline nomifensin viloxazine
8) Cerebrospinal fluid CSF corticotropin releasing hormone CRH somatostatin SRIF and thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH were measured by specific radioimmunoassay methods in 86 patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder and in 30 neurologic controls
9) Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH has potential therapeutic applications in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS and related diseases because of its function as a neuroregulator of the anterior horn cell
--------------------
Is Crohn 's disease ( CD ) linked to the consumption of refrigerated food ?
0) Despite the fact that the true origin of ulcerative colitis and Crohn ´ s disease ( UC ) still remain elusive , basic as well as clinical research bring many new data on etiology and pathogenesis of this inflammatory condition .
1) Crohn ' s disease ( CD ) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder characterized by aberrant mucosal Th1 cell activation and production of IL-12 , the major Th1-driving factor .
2) Non-specific inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , including ulcerative colitis and Crohn ` s disease , is a chronic noninfectious inflammatory disease whose incidence is increasingly high , especially in the developed countries .
3) This disease includes three main types : Crohn & prime ; s disease ( CD ) , ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , and IBD-unclassified ( IBD-U ) .
4) A lack of gp96 protein in intestinal macrophages ( IMACs ) from Crohn ` s disease ( CD ) patients correlates with loss of tolerance against the host gut flora , leading to chronic inflammation .
5) Many publications exist on the effects of oral budesonide for the treatment of Crohn s disease ( CD ) .

What is needed for MMP proteins to be functional ?
0) Our results show that MMP genes are up-regulated prior to the induction of cytokines such as TNF-alpha , and that MMP proteins are prominent around blood vessels in LPS-induced neuroinflammation .
1) This function is supplied by matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) proteins , a large family of enzymes responsible for degrading a variety of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components and for modulating the bioactivity of transmembrane receptors and soluble factors .
2) Degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins by matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) is an important regulatory step in the vascular remodeling process .
3) The biological activity of MMPs is regulated at different levels : ( 1 ) gene expression , ( 2 ) activation of precursor proenzyme forms by other MMPs or non-MMP proteins , including thrombin and plasmin , ( 3 ) complex formation with surface and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components and ( 4 ) inhibition by endogenous tissue inhibitors of MMPs , the TIMPs .
4) Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -8 and -9 released by degranulating polymorphonuclear cells ( PMNs ) promote pericellular proteolysis by binding to PMN surfaces in a catalytically active tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMP ) - resistant forms .
5) The active form of MMPs was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ; MMP proteins presence and expression by immunoblotting and zymography analysis ; and mRNA expression of MMPs by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction .
6) Membrane-bound TIMP-1 is the PMN receptor for pro- and active MMP-8 and -9 as shown by the following : 1 ) TIMP-1 is strikingly colocalized with MMP-8 and -9 on activated human PMN surfaces and in PMN extracellular traps ; 2 ) minimal immunoreactive and active Mmp-8 or Mmp-9 are detected on the surface of activatedmurine PMNs ; and 3 ) binding of exogenous Timp-1 ( but not Timp-2 ) tomurine PMNs reconstitutes the binding of exogenous pro-Mmp-8 and pro-Mmp-9 to the surface ofPMNs .
7) Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MT1-MMP/MMP -14 ) is a key enzyme involved in degradation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and various surface-associated proteins that control cell growth , differentiation and survival , plays crucial roles in molecular carcinogenesis , tumor cell growth , invasion , and angiogenesis .
8) Here , we provide an alternative perspective on the homeostatic balance of TIMP and MMP proteins , whereby consideration is given to the possible role of MMPs as cognate inhibitors of the signaling functions of TIMPs .
9) Inhibition of MMP protein expression was also found to correlate with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 and Cf‑GP treatment , as revealed by western blot analysis and RT‑PCR .

2) The authors conclude that skeletal muscle satellite cells are committed to myogenesis and do not spontaneously adopt an adipogenic fate .
3) A plasma membrane glycoprotein common to embryonic chick myoblasts and adult chicken skeletal muscle satellite cells is the antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody C3/1 .
4) The proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells is regulated by multiple regulatory factors including non-coding RNAs .
5) Proliferating skeletal muscle satellite cells are the source of additional myonuclei which allow skeletal muscle to grow and regenerate .
6) Human skeletal muscle satellite cells are activated in response to both resistance and endurance exercise .
7) However , most studies have focused on the ability to transduce mature muscle cells , and have not examined the ability to target myogenic stem cells such as skeletal muscle satellite cells .

Which is the execution time ( complexity ) of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for the alignment of two sequences
0) A modification of the Smith-Waterman algorithm is proposed which makes it possible to align the amino acid sequences obtained by formal translation of the starting nucleotide sequences by taking into account a possible shift of the reading frame
1) The method consists in making an alignment by dynamic programming taking a decision not only letter by letter as in the Smith Waterman algorithm but also by giving a reward when aligning patterns
2) An algorithm for constructing a set of three to six alignments has been developed of which the accuracy of the best alignment exceeds on the average the accuracy of the best alignment that can be constructed using the Smith-Waterman algorithm
3) To infer homology and subsequently gene function the Smith-Waterman algorithm is used to find the optimal local alignment between two sequences
4) Sequence alignment is performed by pClust using the Smith-Waterman algorithm which is known to give optimal alignment and hence greater accuracy than BLAST-based methods
5) The technique is based on an extension of the Smith-Waterman algorithm that allows the calculation of sub-optimal alignments of a sequence against itself
6) To this end this study proposes the PAAVLS algorithm that follows the dynamic programming technique employed by the Smith-Waterman algorithm and largely reduces the demand of memory
7) Common solution to this problem is an employment of the BLAST that may miss significant alignments or an exhaustive Smith-Waterman algorithm that is very time-consuming
8) While this result is not an asymptotic improvement over the original Smith-Waterman algorithm its complexity is characterized in terms of some sparse features of the matrix and it yields the fastest software implementation to date for such searches
9) The Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment is one of the most important techniques in computational molecular biology

Are adenylyl cyclases always transmembrane proteins ?
0) The HAMP domain is present in a large number of transmembrane proteins in prokaryotes including histidine kinases adenylyl cyclases chemotaxis receptors and phosphatases
1) Do lipids such as sphingomyelin SM that are known to assemble into specific membrane domains play a role in the organization and function of transmembrane proteins
2) More than five dozen type 1 transmembrane proteins including amyloid precursor protein Notch and Delta are substrates for γ-secretase and their ICDs are released from the cell membrane
3) A novel Mr 28,000 erythrocyte transmembrane protein was recently purified and found to exist in two forms 28kDa and gly28kDa the latter containing N-linked carbohydrate Denker B. M. Smith B. L. Kuhajda F. P. and Agre P. 1988 J. Biol
4) The main functional roles of transmembrane proteins are the transport of small molecules and cell signaling and sometimes these two roles are coupled
5) Less is known about the consequences of palmitoylation in transmembrane proteins not only due to the dual difficulty of following a lipid modification and dealing with membrane proteins but also due to the complexity of the palmitoylation-induced behavior
6) The proposed receptor protein family is tentatively identified as an epithelial cell surface mucin constituting one or more of many classes of single-pass transmembrane proteins
7) Protein protein docking methodology is frequently used to model complexes of transmembrane proteins in particular oligomers of G protein-coupled receptors GPCRs even if its applicability for these systems has never been fully validated
8) We suggest that there is a structurally varied group of collagenous transmembrane proteins whose biosynthesis is characterized by a coiled-coil motif following the transmembrane domain and that these trimerization domains appear to be associated with each of the collagenous domains
9) The transient dimerization of transmembrane proteins is an important event in several cellular processes and computational methods are being increasingly used to quantify their underlying energetics

1) The transcription factors that regulate these changes in the setting of reduced PGC-1 are unknown but Myc can regulate glucose metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis during cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in cancer cells
2) PGC-1alpha a potent transcriptional coactivator is the major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and activity in the cardiac muscle
3) And inhibition of reactive oxygen species and enhancing the transcriptional network controlling mitochondrial biogenesis can mitigate the SO2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction
4) To identify transcriptional pathways regulated by CHF1/Hey2 we cultured primary neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes from wild type and transgenic mice overexpressing CHF1/Hey2 and treated them with serum a potent hypertrophic stimulus
5) Together our data indicate that hypoxia can stimulate the expression of PGC-1alpha and mitochondrial biogenesis in the cardiac myocytes and this process might provide a potential adaptive mechanism for cardiac myocytes to increase ATP output and minimize hypoxic damage to the heart
6) These data suggest a novel potential role of valsartan in modulating myocardial autophagy and mitochondrial turnover in renovascular hypertension-induced hypertensive heart disease which may possibly bolster cardiac repair via a blood pressure-independent manner
7) Melatonin ameliorates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in type 1 diabetic rats by preserving mitochondrial function role of AMPK-PGC-1α-SIRT3 signaling
8) Among physiological aspects of mitochondria that have been associated with neurodegeneration and may be interesting to investigate in Friedreich 's ataxia we can include mitochondrial dynamics and movement communication with other organelles especially the endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control
9) The Hippo-Yap pathway was originally recognized as a crucial signal cascade controlling organ size and more recently identified as an important component involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte survival proliferation and regeneration

What is the mechanism of cementogenesis in pulp regeneration ?
0) Since cementum regeneration is poorly understood we used a dog model of dental pulpal necrosis and in vitro cellular wounding and mineralization assays to determine the mechanism of action of calcium hydroxide Ca OH 2 in cementogenesis
1) Initiation of osteogenesis and cementogenesis is a problem central to periodontal regeneration
2) It is proposed that demineralization enhances cementogenesis the key to dentoalveolar healing by removing the smear layer barrier and exposing the organic component collagen fibrils of resected cementum and dentin
3) Cementum proteins role in cementogenesis biomineralization periodontium formation and regeneration
4) The geometry of the attachment apparatus of a tooth is important for the interpretation of the induction of cementogenesis with de novo Sharpey 's fibres as in thecodonty ie a tripartite attachment of alveolar bone periodontal ligament and cementum
5) This finding is in agreement with previous observations of tissue surrounding retrograde dentin-bonded composite fillings placed in monkeys indicating that tissue regeneration including cementogenesis may occur on composite material and consequently form a biological closure of the root canal
6) It has been shown that Emdogain Gel Emd-Gel containing enamel matrix proteins promotes biomineralization such as osteogenesis and cementogenesis during the regeneration of periodontal tissues
7) The TGF-βmight have been responsible for the induction of cementogenesis not only in extant P. ursinus but also in Diatectomorpha and mosasaurs thus providing continuous evolutionary mechanisms for the induction of tissue morphogenesis across animal phyla for almost a billion years of evolution epitomizing Nature 's parsimony in controlling tissue induction and morphogenesis
8) The presence of morphogenetic signals within the cemental matrix capable of inducing bone formation needs now to be assigned bone induction initiated by extracted and partially purified cemental matrices may be the result of a slow release of embryonic remnants of osteogenic signals required and deployed during cementogenesis
9) There is increasing evidence that the cells of the epithelial root sheath synthesize enamel matrix proteins and that these proteins play a fundamental role in cementogenesis and periodontal tissue formation

Which are the subunits of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the canonical pathway activation ?
0) Inhibition of Wnt β-Catenin pathway and Histone acetyltransferase activity by Rimonabant a therapeutic target for colon cancer
1) Palmitic acid is a toll-like receptor 4 ligand that induces human dendritic cell secretion of IL-1β
2) IL-1β caused an activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways MEKK-1 regulated the activation of the canonical pathway while NIK regulated the activation of the noncanonical pathway
3) Here we show that 3-Cl-AHPC activated both IκB kinase IKK α and IKKβ with subsequent activation of the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways in the human breast carcinoma and leukemia cell lines
4) Present data support previous findings suggesting an important role for RAC1b in the development of follicular cell-derived thyroid malignancies and point out NF-kB activation as one of the molecular mechanisms associated with the pro-tumorigenic advantage of RAC1b overexpression in thyroid carcinomas
5) It is currently thought that Wnt receptor Frizzled Frz exists separately to Wnt coreceptors LRP5 and LRP6 LRP5/6 and that Wnt-Frz-LRP5 6 triple complex formation bridged by Wnt ligand is needed for canonical pathway activation
6) Given that β-catenin nuclear localization constitutes a good surrogate marker of Wnt canonical pathway activation we have investigated the distribution of β-catenin in spindle cell lesions of the breast and whether it could be employed in the differential diagnosis of these lesions
7) Our data also indicated that inhibitory κB kinase was the catalytic subunit primarily involved in canonical pathway activation and TJ barrier opening
8) TNF stimulation induces TNF-associated factor-1 TRAF-1 that directly binds NF-κB-inducing kinase NIK and stabilizes it from degradation by disrupting its interaction with TRAF2 cIAP2 ubiquitin ligase complex
9) Autocrine Wnt signaling in the mouse mammary tumor virus model was the first identified mechanism of canonical pathway activation in cancer
--------------------
Which are the genes thought to be regulated by EWS / FLI ?
0) We recently demonstrated that EWS/FLI , the most common EWS/ETS fusion in Ewing 's sarcoma , regulates a portion of its target genes , including the critical target NR0B1 , via GGAA-containing microsatellites in their promoters .
1) In a parallel approach , we found that EWS/FLI uses GGAA microsatellites to regulate the expression of some of its target genes including NR0B1 , a gene required for Ewing 's sarcoma oncogenesis .
2) Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 ( GLI1 ) is a critical target gene activated by EWS/FLI , but the mechanism by which GLI1 contributes to the transformed phenotype of Ewing sarcoma was unknown .
3) We recently showed that EWS/FLI interacts with GGAA-microsatellites to regulate some of its target genes , including NR0B1 , an EWS/FLI-regulated gene that is required for the oncogenic phenotype of Ewing 's sarcoma .
4) Although EWS/FLI -1 alters the expression of various genes , the precise mechanism by which EWS/FLI -1 acts as an oncogene remains to be defined .
5) The EWS-FLI-1 gene product regulates the expression of a number of genes important for cancer progression , can transform mouse cells such as NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 , and is necessary for proliferation and tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma cells , suggesting that EWS-FLI-1 is the causative oncogene .
6) We recently showed that EWS/FLI regulates one of its key targets , NR0B1 , through a GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter .
7) Here , we further investigated the regulation of PLD2 gene expression by EWS/Fli -1 and Fli-1 in another EWS cell line , and also in EWS/Fli -1 - or Fli-1-transfected cell line .
8) Apart from the chimeric oncoprotein that derives from the fusion of EWS and FLI genes , recent genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility variants near the EGR2 gene that regulate DNA binding of EWS-FLI .
9) We used transcriptional profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify genes that are regulated by NR0B1 , and compared these data to similar data for EWS/FLI .
--------------------
Which are the enzymes involved in the addition of 7-methylguanosine in mRNA ?
0) Among enzymes involved in ROS production or degradation , we found a specific reduction in thioredoxin-1 ( Trx-1 ) mRNA ( approximately 52 + / -7 % decrease , p < 0.01 vs control cells ) and protein ( approximately 60 + / -4 % decrease , p < 0.001 vs control cells ) levels in cells overexpressing REDD2 in comparison to control cells .
1) At least two decapping enzymes , Dcp2 and Nudt16 , and an array of decapping regulatory proteins remove the m ( 7 ) G cap from an mRNA exposing the 5 ' - end to exonucleolytic decay .
2) To identify the SeV protein ( s ) involved in mRNA cap methylation , we developed an in vitro assay system to detect mRNA ( guanine-7 - ) methyltransferase ( G-7-MTase ) activity .
3) In addition , significantly increased mRNA levels of histamine methyltransferase ( HMT ) , a key enzyme involved in histamine metabolism , were found in the SN and in the PU in PD .
4) mRNA level and enzyme activity of beta-amyrin synthase ( bAS ) , an oxidosqualene cyclase ( OSC ) situated at the branching point for oleanane-type triterpene saponin biosynthesis , were up-regulated by MeJA , whereas those of cycloartenol synthase , an OSC involved in sterol biosynthesis , were relatively constant .
5) The recent demonstration that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rai1 protein selectively hydrolyzes aberrantly capped mRNAs provides new insights into the modulation of mRNA that lack a canonical m ( 7 ) G cap 5 ' - end .
6) Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 2 ( APOBEC2 ) was originally identified as a member of the cytidine deaminase family with putative nucleotide editing activity .
7) In particular , unlike cellular G-7-MTase , the SeV enzyme preferentially methylated capped RNA containing the viral mRNA 5 ' - end sequences ( GpppApGpG - ) .
8) Although the analog DENSPM has been regarded as the most potent inducer of SSAT activity and mRNA , we now report that inhibitors of protein synthesis are capable of increasing SSAT mRNA to nearly comparable levels .
9) Apart from guanosine addition to the 5 ' end in the most typical cap structure common to transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II ( in particular mRNA ) , essentially all cap modifications are due to methylation .

Which protein interacts with the Ragulator-RAG GTPases to control mTOR activity ?
0) While NPRL2 interacts with Rag GTPases , RagD in particular , to interfere with mTORC1 activity in amino acid scarcity , NPRL2 interacts with Raptor in amino acid sufficiency to activate mTORC1 .
1) We find that the Rag proteins -- a family of four related small guanosine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) -- interact with mTORC1 in an amino acid-sensitive manner and are necessary for the activation of the mTORC1 pathway by amino acids .
2) Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) by amino acids is mediated in part by the Rag GTPases , which bind the raptor subunit of mTORC1 in an amino acid-stimulated manner and promote mTORC1 interaction with Rheb-GTP , the immediate activator .
3) Collectively , our results indicate that EtOH inhibits the anabolic effects that Leu has on protein synthesis and mTORC1 activity by modulating both Rag GTPase function and AMPK/TSC2/Rheb signaling .
4) mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) , a protein kinase complex , is the major target of rapamycin , and is a key element of evolutionarily conserved pathways that regulate cellular metabolism in response to environmental nutrients and intracellular energy status .

How many periods of regulatory innovation led to the evolution of vertebrates ?
0) Neural crest cells are the primary innovation that led to evolution of the vertebrates and transcription factors of the SoxE family Sox8 Sox9 and Sox10 are among the central players regulating the development of these cells
1) The adaptive immune system has long been considered a key evolutionary innovation of the vertebrates the product of two rounds of genome duplication that gave rise to the raw material necessary for the evolution of a highly specific immune response and immune memory
2) Evolutionarily the neural crest is of interest as an important innovation in vertebrates
3) Until recently the lack of a proper Nt/Trk system in invertebrates has lead to the belief that they were a vertebrate innovation
4) For example the gecko adhesive system is a remarkable innovation that permits locomotion on surfaces unavailable to other animals but has been lost or simplified in species that have reverted to a terrestrial lifestyle
5) The nearest invertebrate relatives of the vertebrates such as the ascidians sea squirts and amphioxus have only basic light detecting organs leading to the widely-held view that the vertebrate lens is an innovation that evolved in early vertebrates
6) This ventral grooved blubber directly relates to their intermittent lunge feeding strategy which is unique among vertebrates and was potentially an evolutionary innovation that led to gigantism in this lineage 1
7) The evolution of endothermy is one of the most significant events in vertebrate evolution
8) Elucidating the mechanisms that control SoxE function is essential to understand the evolutionary origin of the vertebrates as well as a host of SoxE-linked syndromes and diseases and may prove crucial for developing stem cell based therapies that target SoxE-regulated cell types
9) These data together with knowledge of the morphological physiological and gene expression similarities between the C. intestinalis ocellus and vertebrate retina have led us to propose a hypothesis for the evolution of the vertebrate lens and integrated vertebrate eye via the co-option and combination of ancient gene regulatory networks one controlling morphogenetic aspects of lens development and one controlling the expression of a gene family responsible for the biophysical properties of the lens with the components of the retina having evolved from an ancestral photoreceptive organ derived from the anterior central nervous system
--------------------
Which are the state-of-the-art computational tools for the prediction of gene fusion events ?

Which is the definition of pyknons in DNA ?
0) In a recent paper in PNAS Rigoutsos et al. 2006 describe a nonrandom pattern of repeated elements called pyknons which are found more frequently in the 3 untranslated regions of genes than in other regions of the human genome
1) The Executive Committee of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ICTV has recently decided to modify the current definition of virus species Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature Rule 3.21 and will soon ask the full ICTV membership 189 voting members to ratify the proposed controversial change
2) Our analysis suggests that units of genetic information encoded in the linear sequences of the 3.6 billion bases of human genome are condensed in approximately 200,000 bases 0.006 of 5 UTR pyknons which are represented by hundreds of copies in a genome and utilized to build genome-unique sequences
3) Because of the association of pyknons with siRNAs and localization to silenced regions of heterochromatin we postulate that RNA-mediated gene silencing leads to the accumulation of gene sequences in non-coding DNA regions
4) A critical examination of how the Catholic tradition 's normative ethical framework accounts for moral subjectivity in end-of-life decision making serves to aid nursing 's discomfort and as a starting point to recontextualize moral distress
5) To test the idea that proximity was required for exon definition we inserted random DNA fragments from Escherichia coli into a central exon in a three-exon dihydrofolate reductase minigene and tested whether the expanded exons were efficiently spliced
6) Because the A. thaliana and human genomes have approximately the same number of genes but drastically different amounts of non-coding DNA these data reveal that pyknons represent a biologically important link between coding and non-coding DNA
7) Over half a century ago a Canadian judge defined a profession in a way that resonates still today not only for lawyers and doctors but for the current wide variety of professions and professionals
8) Cross-genome comparisons reveal that many of the pyknons have instances in the 3 UTRs of genes from other vertebrates and invertebrates where they are overrepresented in similar biological processes as in the human genome
9) Among the millions of discovered patterns we found a subset of 127,998 patterns termed pyknons which have additional nonoverlapping instances in the untranslated and protein-coding regions of 30,675 transcripts from 20,059 human genes

4) What people with Down Syndrome can teach us about cardiopulmonary disease
5) Down Syndrome DS or trisomy 21 T21 is the most frequent and the best known malformation syndrome associated with mental deficiency that appears in human
6) While there is debate over issues involved in choosing between first and second trimester screening the most effective screening test for Down Syndrome is the integrated test based on the integration of the first trimester and the second trimester markers
7) Children with constitutional trisomy 21 cT21 Down Syndrome DS are at a higher risk for both myeloid and B-lymphoid leukaemias
8) One of these is the multidisciplinary Down syndrome team at the Alberta Children 's Hospital which provides assessment treatment and support based on established the Down Syndrome Medical Guidelines Cohen 1999 to children with Down syndrome

Which are the different proteins / isoforms encoded but the ASPH ( aspartate beta-hydroxylase ) gene in humans ?
0) Aspartate-glutamate carrier isoform 1 ( AGC1 ) , encoded by SLC25A12 gene , catalyzes an exchange between intramitochondrial aspartate and cytosolic glutamate plus a proton across the mitochondrial membrane , so supplying aspartate to the cytosol .

9) Aspartate-β-hydroxylase ( ASPH ) is a type II transmembrane protein highly expressed in PDACs ( 97.1 % ) but not normal pancreas .
--------------------
What is known as the cause of subacute thyroiditis ?
0) Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis ( SAT ) , also known as de Quervain 's thyroiditis or painful subacute thyroiditis , is the commonest thyroid condition responsible for neck tenderness .
1) As subacute thyroiditis is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in our community , the authors believe all people with hyperthyroidism should have a thyroid scan unless they have distinctive features of Graves ' disease .
2) Autoimmune postpartum and subacute thyroiditis , tumors that secrete thyrotropin , and drug-induced thyroid dysfunction , are also important causes .
3) de Quervain thyroiditis , also known as subacute thyroiditis , is a self-limited inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland .
4) Autoimmune postpartum and subacute thyroiditis , tumours that secrete thyrotropin , and drug-induced thyroid dysfunction , are also important causes .
5) Silent thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis are important causes of transient thyrotoxicosis from rapidly progressive tissue injury , followed by the release of thyroid hormone into the circulation .
6) Although the main mechanism of 131I uptake suppression in the thyroid gland in subacute thyroiditis is due to cellular damage and suppression of TSH release , our present findings suggest that IL-1 , TNF alpha , and IFN gamma produced in the inflammatory process within the thyroid gland further inhibit iodine incorporation and at least partly account for the decreased 131I uptake by the thyroid gland in destruction-induced hyperthyroidism .
7) Although the cause of subacute thyroiditis remains unclear , viral infection has been implicated in the onset of subacute thyroiditis in genetically predisposed individuals .
8) We speculate that the infection of the thyroid gland may cause subacute thyroiditis , a transient form of thyroiditis causing hyperthyroidism , resulting in changes in adrenocortical activity that could lead to hormonal dysfunction , thereby distinguishing the clinical presentation of rabies in the rabid host .
9) The term `` subacute thyroiditis '' has come to be applied to two rather distinct forms of inflammation of the thyroid gland , both of which run courses lasting several weeks to several months .

How is myotonic dystrophy inherited ?
0) myotonic dystrophy also called the Curschmann-Steinert syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscular dystrophy muscle weakness and myotonia which can affect both mother and child
1) The most common form of inherited muscular dystrophy in adults is myotonic dystrophy DM an autosomal-dominant disease caused by the expansion of an unstable CTG repeat sequence in the 3 untranslated region of the myotonin protein kinase DMPK gene
2) Children who inherit the autosomal dominant gene for myotonic dystrophy from their mother rather than their father may develop the severe neonatal type rather than the late onset type
3) The recent discovery of inherited unstable DNA sequences first in fragile-X mental retardation and now in myotonic dystrophy not only confirms that anticipation indeed has a true biological basis but provides a specific molecular mechanism for it this discovery can explain many of the puzzling anomalies in the inheritance of myotonic dystrophy and may prove relevant to comparable problems in other genetic disorders

Which protein is required for Argonaute 2 recruitment to stress granules and P-bodies ?
0) NRDE-2 associates with the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 within nuclei and is recruited by NRDE-3 / siRNA complexes to nascent transcripts that have been targeted by RNAi .
1) First observed in human cells , small RNA-induced gene activation , also known as RNAa , involves the targeted recruitment of Argonaute proteins to specific promoter sequences followed by induction of stable epigenetic changes which promote transcription .
2) Small regulatory RNAs including small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) and microRNAs ( miRNAs ) guide Argonaute ( Ago ) proteins to specific target RNAs leading to mRNA destabilization or translational repression .
3) These effector sites include the active site , to prevent target cleavage ; the binding groove , to modify nucleic acid binding affinity ; and surface allosteric sites , to control recruitment of additional proteins to form the RISC .
4) PRMT1 methylates the single Argonaute of Toxoplasma gondii and is important for the recruitment of Tudor nuclease for target RNA cleavage by antisense guide RNA .
5) As core components of the microRNA-induced silencing complex ( miRISC ) , Argonaute ( AGO ) proteins interact with TNRC6 proteins , recruiting other effectors of translational repression/mRNA destabilization .
6) Among these proteins are Argonaute 1 ( Ago1 ) and Argonaute 2 ( Ago2 ) , factors that are important for RNA silencing and whose interactions with A3G are resistant to RNase treatment .
7) siRNAs associate with the RNAi effector protein Argonaute 1 ( Ago1 ) , targeting the Ago1-containing RNA-induced transcriptional silencing ( RITS ) complex to homologous nascent transcripts .
8) At the heart of all small RNA-mediated silencing lies the key RNAi effector protein Argonaute , which once loaded with small RNAs can recognize its target transcript by siRNA-RNA Watson-Crick base pairing interactions .
9) Proper AGO1 and AGO2 recruitment to CD44 transcribed regions required the endonuclease Dicer and the chromobox protein HP1γ , and resulted in increased histone H3 lysine 9 methylation on variant exons .

0) The Dubai Thalassemia Center has identified 35 different beta-thalassemia mutations in 570 chromosomes from the United Arab Emirates population using gene amplification hybridization with specific labeled oligonucleotide probes sequencing of amplified DNA restriction enzymes and amplification refractory mutation system techniques
1) Realizing that a direct assay for the beta S gene already exists and that most cases of beta-thalassemia in Mediterraneans can be directly diagnosed using synthetic oligonucleotide probes we illustrate the above technique by examining nine DNA polymorphisms in the human beta-globin cluster for their ability to diagnose sickle-cell anemia in American blacks and beta-thalassemia in Mediterraneans
2) Analyses of DNA from 64 patients with thalassemia major using the hybridization technique of amplified DNA with radiolabeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes identified 13 different beta-thalassemia mutations
3) We have identified different beta-thalassemia mutations in 93 members of 34 families of Czech or Slovakian descent using gene amplification hybridization with specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes sequencing of amplified DNA and gene mapping

7) A method for diagnosis of alpha o thalassemia was developed based on detection of accumulated PCR product using SYBR Green I a double-stranded DNA binding dye and a fluorescence-detecting thermocycler
8) The molecular abnormality of a patient with thalassemia intermedia was identified by DNA amplification PCR combined with the use of synthetic oligonucleotide probes
9) In order to clarify the reasons for the reduced Hb A2 levels in Sardinian delta beta-thalassemia we characterized both by cloning and sequence analysis and by direct sequencing of amplified DNA the delta-globin gene from an individual of Sardinian descent who is a compound heterozygote for the beta zero-thalassemia codon 39 C T nonsense mutation and the Sardinian delta beta-thalassemia codon 39 C T -196 C T A gamma
--------------------
Which diseases are associated with Alu element insertion ?
0) Although Alu insertions have been implicated in other diseases , and a closely related AluY element is found as an insert in the C1 inhibitor gene in patients with hereditary angioedema , this is the first case of glycerol kinase deficiency caused by an Alu insertion .
1) We found a disease-specific SVA ( short interspersed nuclear element , variable number of tandem repeats , and Alu composite ) retrotransposon insertion in an intron of the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 1 gene ( TAF1 ) , which encodes the largest component of the TFIID complex , and significantly decreased expression levels of TAF1 and the dopamine receptor D2 gene ( DRD2 ) in the caudate nucleus .
2) Mining the databases for putative retroposition-competent elements that share 100 % nucleotide identity to the previously reported de novo Alu insertions linked to human diseases resulted in the retrieval of 13 exact matches to the NF1 Alu repeat , three to the Alu element in BRCA2 , and one to the Alu element in FGFR2 ( Apert syndrome ) .
3) Ancestral DYT3 haplotype and disease-specific SVA ( short interspersed nuclear element , variable number of tandem repeats , and Alu composite ) retrotransposon insertion were identified in the DYT3 proband and two female unaffected family members .
4) Over the past decade , the insertion/deletion ( I/D ) polymorphism of a 287-bp Alu element in intron 16 of the ACE gene has attracted significant attention and has been extensively investigated in a spectrum of cardiovascular phenotypes , because of its correlation with serum ACE activity .
5) Although most of mobile elements are fixed within the human population , some elements ( including ALU , long interspersed elements ( LINE ) 1 ( L1 ) , and SVA ) are still actively duplicating and may result in life-threatening human diseases such as cancer , motivating the need for accurate mobile-element insertion ( MEI ) detection tools .
6) Mobile element insertions ( MEI ) have been identified as causes for genetic diseases , including hemophilia , neurofibromatosis , and various cancers .
7) Using the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) on genomic DNA isolated from patients with AMD ( n = 173 ) , and an age-matched control population ( n = 189 ) , we amplified a region polymorphic for an Alu element insertion in the ACE gene .
8) In this report , we studied a mutant CASR with an Alu-repetitive element inserted at codon 876 , which was identified in affected members of families with the hypercalcemic disorders , familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia ( FHH ) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism ( NSHPT ) , to understand how this insertion affects CASR function .
9) While the results are variable and sometimes inconsistent , and corroborating phenotypic data limited , carriers of the ACE ` insertion ' allele ( the presence of an alu repeat element in intron 16 of the gene ) have been reported to have higher maximum oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) , greater response to training , and increased muscle efficiency when compared with individuals carrying the ` deletion ' allele ( absence of the alu repeat ) .

6) The recent findings that dysfunctional NAADP release leads to defective endocytic function which in turn results in secondary lipid accumulation in the lysosomal storage disease Niemann-Pick type C , is the first evidence of a direct connection between a human disease and defective lysosomal calcium release .
7) Gaucher disease , a prevalent lysosomal storage disease ( LSD ) , is caused by insufficient activity of acid β-glucosidase ( GCase ) and the resultant glucosylceramide ( GC ) / glucosylsphingosine ( GS ) accumulation in visceral organs ( Type 1 ) and the central nervous system ( Types 2 and 3 ) .
8) Gaucher disease , the most common lysosomal storage disease , can be treated with enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) , in which defective acid-beta-glucosidase ( GlcCerase ) is supplemented by a recombinant , active enzyme .

What are the effects of depleting protein km23-1 ( DYNLRB1 ) in a cell ?
0) N-acetyl-D-glucosamine kinase ( GlcNAc kinase or NAGK ) primarily catalyzes phosphoryl transfer to GlcNAc during amino sugar metabolism .
1) We show that small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) depletion of km23-1 in human CRC cells inhibited constitutive extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) activation , as well as pro-invasive ERK effector functions that include phosphorylation of Elk-1 , constitutive regulation of c-Fos-DNA binding , TGFβ1 promoter transactivation , and TGFβ1 secretion .
2) Recently , it was shown NAGK interacts with dynein light chain roadblock type 1 ( DYNLRB1 ) and upregulates axo-dendritic growth , which is an enzyme activity-independent , non-canonical structural role .
3) We established cell lines lacking WDR60 or TCTEX1D2 , both of which are dynein-2-specific subunits encoded by ciliopathy-causing genes , and found that both WDR60-knockout ( KO ) and TCTEX1D2-KO cells show defects in retrograde ciliary protein trafficking , with WDR60-KO cells demonstrating more severe defects probably due to failed assembly of the dynein-2 complex .
4) These results indicate that the NAGK-dynein interaction with the involvements of Lis1 and NudE1 plays an important role in prophase nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEB ) and metaphase MT-KT attachment during eukaryotic cell division .
5) Moreover , km23-1 depletion in human CRC cells reduced cell migration and invasion , as well as expression of the ERK-regulated , metastasis-associated scaffold protein Ezrin .
6) A proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) for NAGK and DYNLRB1 revealed NAGK-dynein complex on nuclear envelopes in prophase cells and on chromosomes in metaphase cells .
7) Here we examined the functional role of this signaling regulatory protein ( km23-1 ) in mediating the migration , invasion , and tumor growth of human colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) cells .
8) On the other hand , inhibiting the endogenous DYNLRB1 with gene-specific small interfering RNA or pharmacologically with a specific inhibitor ( vanadate ) led to a significant ( P < 0.05 ) decrease in folate uptake .
9) The dynein-2 complex can be divided into three subcomplexes , namely DYNC2H1-DYNC2LI1 , WDR34-DYNLL1 / DYNLL2-DYNLRB1 / DYNLRB2 , and WDR60-TCTEX1D2-DYNLT1 / DYNLT3 .
--------------------
Is the gene DUX4 epigenetically regulated in somatic cells ?
0) We found also that ectopically expressed DUX4 up-regulates the endogenous human FRG1 gene in healthy muscle cells , while DUX4 knockdown leads to a decrease in FRG1 expression in FSHD muscle cells .
1) The DUX gene family includes DUX4 , the intronless Dux macrosatellites in rat and mouse , as well as several intron-containing members ( DUXA , DUXB , Duxbl , and DUXC ) .
2) Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that DUX4 recruits p300 to its target gene , ZSCAN4 , displaces histone H3 from the center of its binding site , and induces H3K27Ac in its vicinity , but C-terminal deleted DUX4 does not .
3) One of the potential treatment options is the use of effective antisense oligonucleotides ( AOs ) to knockdown expression of the myopathic DUX4 gene and its downstream molecules including paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 ( PITX1 ) .
4) Recent molecular advances have identified a novel , clinically aggressive subgroup of undifferentiated round cell sarcomas defined molecularly by oncogenic fusion of the gene , CIC , and either DUX4 or its paralog , DUX4L , herein termed CIC-DUX sarcomas .
5) Fusion between CIC and DUX4 up-regulates PEA3 family genes in Ewing-like sarcomas with t ( 4 ; 19 ) ( q35 ; q13 ) translocation .
6) Individuals with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD ) have a partial failure of somatic DUX4 repression resulting in the presence of DUX4 protein in sporadic muscle nuclei .
7) Here we show that CIC , a human homolog of Drosophila capicua which encodes a high mobility group box transcription factor , is fused to a double homeodomain gene DUX4 as a result of a recurrent chromosomal translocation t ( 4 ; 19 ) ( q35 ; q13 ) .
8) Transgenic Drosophila for Investigating DUX4 and FRG1 , Two Genes Associated with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy ( FSHD ) .
9) Recently , in a subset of patients without D4Z4 repeat contractions , variants in the SMCHD1 gene have been identified that lead to hypomethylation of D4Z4 and thus DUX4 transcription , which causes FSHD type 2 .

Which drugs acting via bradykinin system are effective for treatment of ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema ?
0) Conclusion The efficacy of treatment of ACEI-induced angioedema with bradykinin antagonists , kallikrein inhibitor , and C1 inhibitor warrants further study .
1) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) , relatively new antihypertensive agents , act by blocking the formation of angiotensin II , a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone formation .
2) Three new treatments have recently become available : a kallikrein inhibitor that prevents bradykinin release , an antagonist of bradykinin receptors that blocks bradykinin action , and a recombinant human C1-INH molecule produced in transgenic rabbits that replaces the deficient protein .

7) Three new treatments , an inhibitor of kallikrein to prevent bradykinin release , an antagonist of the bradykinin receptor to prevent its action and a recombinant human C1-INH produced in transgenic animals , are under clinical evaluation currently .
8) Plasma-derived C1-INH , bradykinin receptor antagonists ( icatibant ) , kallikrein inhibitors ( ecallantide ) , or recombinant C1-INH is authorized on the market for HAE attack therapy or prophylaxis .
9) Although there is a small risk for anaphylaxis , which limits home administration , ecallantide is a novel , safe , effective and alternative treatment for acute HAE attacks .

0) The study seeks to describe the use of dietary supplements promoted for cardiovascular health and the relation between supplement use and coronary artery disease CAD and the presence of major CAD risk factors
1) Use of dietary supplements among United States adults with coronary artery disease and atherosclerotic risks
2) Renal insufficiency vitamin B 12 status and population attributable risk for mild hyperhomocysteinemia among coronary artery disease patients in the era of folic acid-fortified cereal grain flour
3) For primary prevention in patients with moderate risk for a coronary event we recommend aspirin 75-100 mg/d over either no antithrombotic therapy or vitamin K antagonist Grade 1A
4) This case of STEMI associated as it is with the use of a synephrine-containing product by a person without risk factors for coronary artery disease is to our knowledge the 1st reported in the literature
5) We conclude that these haemodynamic variations leading to an increase in EVR support the use of midazolam as a supplement to fentanyl anaesthesia for patients with coronary artery disease
6) The findings of the present randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial clearly support the efficacy of H. persicum fruit extract as a safe antioxidant supplement in subjects with minimal CAD
7) Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of use of these substances when young patients with no risk factors for coronary artery disease present with acute arrhythmias heart failure and myocardial infarctions
8) Detection of diastolic murmurs from post-stenotic coronary turbulence with an acoustic sensor placed on the chest wall can serve as an easy safe and low-cost supplement to assist in the diagnosis of CAD
9) The cholesterol lowering and improvement in lipid/HDL risk ratios suggests that these combinations may have antiatherosclerotic properties and may protect against the development of coronary artery disease
--------------------
What is the role of the RUNX1-MYEF2 complex ?
0) These findings suggest that RUNX1 and CBFBeta in addition to RUNX3 play some roles in gastric cancers and that roles of RUNX gene family in gastric cancer are more widespread and complex than previously realized
1) The importance of the RUNX/CBF β core factor binding complex in breast cancer has very recently been highlighted with both RUNX1 and CBFβ appearing in a comprehensive gene list of predicted breast cancer driver mutations

3) In this report we define the minimal promoter region of the SET gene and identify a novel multi-protein transcription complex composed of MYC SP1 RUNX1 and GATA2 which activates SET expression in AML
4) The AML1 gene also known as RUNX1 or CBFA2 located in chromosome band 21q22 encodes a transcription factor which heterodimerizes with the CBFbeta protein forming a complex called human core binding factor CBF
5) To address this problem we determined the crystal structure of the ternary complex containing Runx1 1-242 and Ets1 296-441 bound to T-cell receptor alpha TCRα enhancer DNA
6) As for the mechanism of the different roles of AML1 in the regulation of the c-mpl promoter we found that AML1 forms a complex with a transcription repressor mSin3A on the c-mpl promoter in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells although it forms a complex with a transcription activator p300 on the same promoter in megakaryocytic cells
7) Here we evaluated the possible effect of MSCs on the mRNA expression of Runx complex genes Runx1 Runx3 and CBFB that perch on TSDR in iTregs and play the main role in suppressive properties of Tregs a regulatory pathway that has not yet been explored by MSCs

3) The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans C. elegans has been at the forefront of small RNA research not only were the first miRNAs and their function as regulators of gene expression discovered in C. elegans but also double-stranded RNA-induced gene silencing by RNAi was discovered in this model organism
4) The introduction of a double-stranded RNA dsRNA into an organism to induce sequence-specific RNA interference RNAi of a target transcript has become a powerful technique to investigate gene function in nematodes and many organisms
5) While sRNAs can move within an organism they can also move between interacting organisms to induce gene silencing a phenomenon called cross-kingdom RNAi
6) One manifestation of RNA silencing known as post-transcriptional gene silencing PTGS in plants and RNA interference RNAi in animals is a nucleotide sequence-specific RNA turnover mechanism with the outstanding property of propagating throughout the organism most likely via movement of nucleic acids
7) Unlike in other eukaryotes in which it causes gene silencing RNA interference RNAi has been linked to programmed DNA deletion in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila
8) The pea aphid is an important agricultural pest and biological model organism and RNA interference RNAi is an important tool for functional genomics and for insect pest management
9) RNA interference RNAi is a gene silencing mechanism that is present in animals and plants and is triggered by double stranded RNA dsRNA or small interfering RNA siRNA depending on the organism

What is the relationship between TailorX and Oncotype ?
0) Oncotype began as a commercial platform the company that produced it did not discover a signature but rather constructed it by asking users at every step what clinical question they wanted the signature to answer and what data would be credible in that regard
1) In this review we describe molecular risk scores for which tests are commercially available PAM50 MammaTyper MammaPrint Oncotype DX Endopredict Genomic Grade Index and IHC risk scores Mammostrat and IHC4 and discuss the current evidence of their clinical use
2) The introduction of US FDA-approved targeted therapy trastuzumab package insert changes irinotecan and tamoxifen and the initiation of a genotype-guided clinical trial for cancer therapy TYMS TSER in rectal cancer along with panels of DNA and expression markers Roche AmpliChip and Oncotype Dx panel are paving the way towards the integration of pharmacogenomics into clinical practice
3) Given that RS has an established strong relationship with prognosis and therapy responsiveness PhH3 may thus also be an important prognostic/predictive marker in breast cancer
4) The multi-gene expression-based assay Oncotype DX ODX is a genomic tumor profiling tool that determines the expression of 21 tumor associated genes it helps determine the risk for distant recurrence and whether chemotherapy is an appropriate course of treatment in patients with early stage estrogen receptor ER positive HER2 negative and lymph node negative or 1-3 positive lymph nodes invasive BCa
5) Oncotype DX is based on 17 genes and focuses on the ability to predict outcomes adverse pathology in very low-low and low-intermediate PCa patients while Prolaris is built on a panel of 46 genes and is validated to evaluate outcomes for patients at low risk as well as patients who are affected by high risk PCa and post-RP
6) So far Oncotype DX Genomic Health Inc. Redwood City CA USA Mammaprint Agendia Inc Huntington Beach CA USA the Breast Cancer Index BCI Biotheranostics San Diego CA USA and PAM50 Expression Analysis Inc. Durham NC USA are the only multigene assays that have been marketed in North America and Europe
7) At present four genomic tools are commercially available Decipher Oncotype DX Prolaris and ProMark
8) The 70-gene assay MammaPrint Agendia Netherlands and the 21-gene assay Oncotype DX Genomic Health USA are the most widely used breast cancer multigene classifier assays

ROSIER scale is used for which disorder ?
0) The Swanson , Nolan , and Pelham Rating Scale ( SNAP-IV ) is a widely used scale that measures the core symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
1) Despite being developed before the formal introduction of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) within the diagnostic literature , the Impact of Event Scale ( Horowitz , Wilner , & Alvarez , 1979 ) remains one of the most widely used self-report measures of posttraumatic stress .
2) Armodafinil , the ( R ) - enantiomer of modafinil , is a medication used to treat the excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy , obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome , and shift work sleep disorder .
3) A new scale for assessing severity in PDA ( Panic Disorder with/without Agoraphobia ) has recently been developed : the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale [ P & A ( Bandelow , 1995 ) ] .
4) Reliability and validity of three commonly used autism scales , the Autism Behavior Checklist ( Krug , Arick , & Almond , 1980 ) , the Real Life Rating Scale ( Freeman , Ritvo , Yokota , & Ritvo , 1986 ) , and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale ( Schopler , Reichler , & Renner , 1988 ) , were investigated .

What is known about MER41 repeat sequences ?
0) For example LTR Finder based on de novo repeat discovery method can accurately predict and annotate LTR retrotransposons for full length sequences Repeat-Masker which is based on homology-based method can discover LTR retrotransposons by comparing the similarity with known sequences in the database
1) The only known repeat on this paternal sex ratio PSR chromosome is the 45S rDNA which includes here five different internal transcribed spacer 2 ITS2 sequences
2) The genome contains two major repeat regions in which 11 units of unassigned sequences and six genes atp8 trnM trnQ trnV and part of cox2 and nad2 are found in repetition in the form of nested direct repeats of unparalleled complexity
3) These clones specify the most proximal known low-order repeat on 21p p21-7D and the most proximal known single-copy sequence on 21q pUT-B37 at locus D21S120
4) Repeats with complex patterns mostly refer to the functional domain repeats such as the well-known leucine-rich repeat and WD repeat which are frequently involved in protein protein interaction
5) We have also shown that a DNA fragment containing the 72 bp repeat inserted directly before chicken conalbumin or adenovirus-2 major late promoter sequences in chimeric plasmids where these promoters replace that of the SV40 early genes caused a dramatic increase in the expression of T-antigen in vivo
6) One of the more widely studied simple repeat sequences in the mammalian genome is the dG-dT n. dC-dA n dinucleotide repeat sequence
7) Using DNA containing 19 or 39 CGG repeats we have found that both the position and number of interruptions modulate the non-B conformation adopted by the repeat sequence
8) Using biotinylated repeat oligonucleotides coupled with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and rapid single-pass hybridization we were able to enrich our plasmid library greater than two-fold for repeat sequences and increase the ability to link these ESTs with known sequences greater than six-fold
9) The role of MMR in triplet repeat instability therefore depends on the repeat sequence and the orientation of replication
