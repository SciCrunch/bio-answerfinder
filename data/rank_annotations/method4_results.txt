What is the association between GERD and gluten ?
0) What GERD does causes discomfort and/or pain with or without destroying the mucosa causes stricture or stenosis preventing food from being swallowed sets the stage for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma invades the surrounding lands to harass the peaceful oropharyngeal laryngeal and broncho-pulmonary territories reminds us that we are not only human but that we are dust and ashes
1) Nonceliac gluten sensitivity NCGS is the clinical term used to describe gastrointestinal GI and/or extraintestinal symptoms associated with gluten ingestion
2) Given the strong association between hiatal hernia and GERD and their risk for developing chronic microaspiration the prominent airway-centered FF in UIP might predict the presence of chronic microaspiration acknowledging that GERD and proton pump inhibitor/histamine -2 receptor antagonist use failed to demonstrate a significant association
3) What is the role of endoscopy and oesophageal biopsies in the management of GERD
4) In this article we review the pathophysiology of GERD its effect on the immune system the effect of acid-blocking medications on allergic responses as well as several common atopic conditions that have been associated with GERD including asthma chronic rhinosinusitis CRS allergic rhinitis AR atopic dermatitis AD contact dermatitis CD food allergies proton pump inhibitor PPI responsive esophageal eosinophilia PPI-REE and eosinophilic esophagitis EoE
5) In this paper we will briefly review GERD AF and hiatal hernias consider the available literature covering the association between these diseases and provide further insight into the topic in general
6) The aim of this research was to conduct a systematic review on the association between dental erosion DE and gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD and the effect of saliva 's flow rate buffering capacity and oral microbial changes caused by GERD
7) CD4 T cells specific for post-translationally modified gluten peptides bound to the disease-predisposing HLA-DQ2 or HLADQ8 molecules are typically found in patients with CD explaining the strong association between these HLA-alleles and the occurrence of CD 1 2
8) Although there is not enough evidence that certain substances in a diet could lead to GERD symptoms the literature suggests that there might be a relationship between reflux development and salt salted foods chocolate fatty foods and fizzy drinks
9) This review considers and emphasizes the association between GERD and non-digestive tract conditions including atrial fibrillation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease primary pulmonary fibrosis and energy metabolism related to diet

Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria ?
0) As pathogenic Escherichia coli or carcinogenic Helicobacter pylori can alter genome integrity through DNA double-strand breaks , leading to chromosomal instability and eventually cancer , our findings highlight possible new routes for further investigations of P. aeruginosa in cancer biology and they identify ATM as a potential target molecule for drug design .
1) Recent evidence suggests that the nucleotide pool is a significant target for oxidants and that oxidized nucleotides , once incorporated into genomic DNA , can lead to the induction of a DNA strand break-associated DDR that triggers senescence in normal cells and in cells sustaining oncogene activation .
2) Strand breaks thus created can be repaired by different mechanisms , including homologous recombination ( HR ) , one of the key mechanisms maintaining genome stability [ A. Britt , DNA damage and repair in plants , Annu .
3) Using extracts of an XPV lymphoblast cell line ( GM2449C ) that has a truncating mutation in the RAD30 gene , we investigated the effect of a ( 6-4 ) photoproduct and a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer ( CPD ) , at a unique - TT - site on either the leading or lagging strand , on plasmid DNA replication .
4) While MOBP plasmids are most frequently targeted in the region entering the recipient cell last ( lagging region ) , MOBF plasmids are mostly targeted in the region entering the recipient cell first ( leading region ) .
5) In eukaryotes , MMR is believed to be directed to the nascent strand by preexisting discontinuities such as gaps between Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand or breaks in the leading strand generated by the mismatch-activated endonuclease of the MutL homologs PMS1 in yeast and PMS2 in vertebrates .
6) We developed an anti-gene peptide nucleic acid ( PNA ) for selective inhibition of MYCN transcription in neuroblastoma cells , targeted against a unique sequence in the antisense DNA strand of exon 2 of MYCN and linked at its NH ( 2 ) terminus to a nuclear localization signal peptide .
7) Damage to DNA can include DNA strand breaks , point mutations due to DNA adducts , as well as alterations in methylation patterns leading to activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors .
8) Nucleolytic processing enzymes such as the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 / CtIP complex , Flap endonuclease ( FEN1 ) and the apurinic endonucleases ( APE1 and APE2 ) also act in the chemical `` cleansing '' of DNA breaks to prevent genomic instability and disease , and promote progression of DNA - and RNA-DNA damage response ( DDR and RDDR ) pathways .
9) By contrast , generation of a DNA single-strand break ( SSB ) , or nick , can stimulate gene correction without the problems of DSB repair because the uncut DNA strand acts as a template to permit healing without alteration of genetic material .

Is there any link between conserved noncoding elements and alternative splicing in vertebrates ?
0) Conserved noncoding elements CNEs in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers but a critical issue is how well orthologous CNE sequences retain the same activity in their respective species a characteristic important for generalization of model organism studies
1) Although few noncoding elements are highly conserved between Drosophila and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae we find that A. gambiae regions orthologous to Drosophila GRBs contain an equivalent distribution of noncoding elements highly conserved in the yellow fever mosquito Aëdes aegypti and coincide with regions of ancient microsynteny between Drosophila and mosquitoes
2) We found zebrafish conserved noncoding elements CNEs with pan-vertebrate as well as fish-specific orthologous sequences from across 200 kb of the zebrafish fgf8a genomic regulatory block to direct reporter expression in patterns consistent with the expression pattern of fgf8a
3) In vertebrates conserved noncoding elements CNEs are functionally constrained sequences that can show striking conservation over 400 million years of evolutionary distance and frequently are located megabases away from target developmental genes
4) We found 113,070 noncoding elements conserved between the two species amounting to 3.3 of the genome
5) Among conserved noncoding elements CNEs that function as enhancers in vertebrate genomes those that are maintained near paralogous genes are of particular interest given their ancient origins
6) These elements are different from other conserved noncoding elements and appear to be important regulatory innovations that became fixed following the emergence of vertebrates from the sea to the land
7) We also identified more than 1,000 long ncRNAs and most of those long ncRNAs contain conserved elements across either 46 vertebrates or 33 placental mammals or 10 primates
8) Conserved noncoding elements CNCs are an abundant feature of vertebrate genomes
9) Vertebrate genomes contain thousands of conserved noncoding elements CNEs that often function as tissue-specific enhancers

8) Safety and tolerability of interleukin-1 antagonists in different doses have been confirmed by numerous observational studies on both large and small cohorts of patients with BD .
9) In particular , the potential for Mycobacterium tuberculosis reactivation and tuberculosis development appears to be significantly lower with interleukin-1 blockers compared to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors , thus increasing the beneficial profile of this approach .

5) It has been demonstrated that serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 SGK1 and the downstream transcription factor forkhead box O1 FoxO1 plays a critical role in the differentiation of T helper 17 cells/regulatory T cells Th17/Treg
6) Protein phosphorylation states can mediate complex formation as well as regulate protein function and this is important for cellular physiology but can likewise contribute to the development of neuropathological conditions
7) Mechanisms employed by SGK1 in transport regulation include direct phosphorylation of target transport proteins phosphorylation and thus activation of other transport regulating kinases stabilization of membrane proteins by phosphorylation and thus inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2 as well as stimulation of transport protein expression by upregulation transcription factors e.g. nuclear factor kappa-B NFκB and by fostering of protein translation
8) Collectively these findings suggest a novel role for GnTs in regulating RIG-I/TBK1 pathway-directed IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-β induction and define virulence determinants within GnTs that may permit the attenuation of pathogenic hantaviruses
9) SGK1 negatively regulates the pro-apoptotic transcription factor Forkhead box O3a FoxO3a via phosphorylation and exclusion from the nucleus

Which protein is affected by dusp8 activation ?
0) The propensity of S100A8/A9 to bind the cytosolic phox proteins , and the effects of S100A8/A9 on the kinetics of oxidase activation , suggest that S100A8/A9 might be a scaffold protein for the cytosolic phox proteins or might help to deliver arachidonic acid to the oxidase , thus favoring the productive interaction of the cytosolic phox proteins with the membrane-bound flavocytochrome b.
1) Membrane receptors that activate G proteins can be considered as such , but other cytosolic , membranal or amphitropic proteins can accelerate the rate of G protein exchange or even activate this process in the absence of receptor-mediated activation .
2) The most rapid are of growth in recent years has been the realization that signaling through both G-protein coupled receptors and adhesion receptors is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation , recruitment of complexes of SH2 , SH3 , and proline-rich signaling molecules to appropriate locations in the cell , and on activation of members of the Ras superfamily of proteins .
3) Inhibition of methylation of rap1 proteins as well as inhibition of platelet activation by AFC suggests that methylation and consequently translocation of rap1 proteins to plasma membrane may be important for agonist-induced signal transduction in human platelets .

Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria ?
0) Our findings indicate that the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd , which is an ATP-dependent superfamily 2 helicase that binds to RNAP , continues to translocate along DNA after RNAP has been displaced until a lesion in the template strand is located .
1) Our data suggest that the coordinate action of CSA and CSB , as part of the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery , regulates the recruitment timing of DNA-binding factors and provide explanations about the mechanism of transcription arrest following genotoxic stress .
2) These findings show that in mammalian cells a RNA polymerase I or RNA polymerase II transcript truncated by a lesion in the template strand may be discarded unless repair is accomplished rapidly by a mechanism that does not displace stalled RNA polymerases .
3) Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd , an ATP-dependent DNA translocase .
4) Our data rule out defective transcription-coupled repair as the cause of the increased sensitivity of CS cells to DNA-damaging agents and suggest that the cellular sensitivity and the prolonged repressed RNA synthesis are primarily due to a transcription defect .
5) We recently found that human cells defective in the DNA mismatch repair gene , hMSH2 , were deficient in the transcription-coupled repair ( TCR ) of both oxidative DNA damage , including thymine glycols , and UV-induced DNA damage .
6) To gain insight into the coupling mechanism between transcription and repair , we have set up an in vitro system in which we isolate an elongating RNA pol IIO , which is stalled in front of a cisplatin adduct .

In which diseases have electronic patient diaries been applied ?
0) The specific aims of this pilot study are to compare the efficacy of diabetic patients documenting their health maintenance data ( i.e. blood glucose levels , meal intake , and exercise ) using an electronic patient diary ( ED ) versus a traditional pen and paper ( PD ) diary ; and determine participants ' satisfaction with each diary approach .
1) The primary objective is to determine whether the use of an electronic diary with a portable spirometer can be performed by COPD patients with a moderate to severe disease .
2) In a randomized crossover trial , 24 patients suffering from chronic cancer and non-cancer pain completed both the electronic and the paper version of a pain diary based on the Minimal Documentation System ( MIDOS ) for pain and symptom assessment .
3) The patient diary serves as the primary means used by patients and care providers to monitor and ensure glycemic control among this population and as a key component to effective diabetes management .

Does thyroid hormone receptor beta1 affect insulin secretion ?
0) Retinoid acid receptor beta2 ( 3p24 ) , thyroid hormone receptor beta1 ( 3p24 .3 ) , Ras association domain family 1A ( 3p21 .3 ) , and the fragile histidine triad gene ( 3p14 .2 ) have been considered as tumor suppressor genes ( TSGs ) for breast cancers .
1) Thyroid hormone action , widely recognized on cell proliferation and metabolism , has recently been related to the phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) , an upstream regulator of the Akt kinase and the involvement of the thyroid hormone receptor beta1 has been hypothesized .
2) Activated by thyroid hormone , the MAPK ( ERK1/2 ) signaling pathway causes serine phosphorylation by MAPK of several nucleoproteins , including the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor beta1 .
3) Furthermore , the association between thyroid hormone receptor beta1 ( TRbeta1 ) and PI3K-regulatory subunit p85alpha , and the inhibition of T3-induced PI3K activation and mTOR phosphorylation by a dominant negative TR ( G345R ) demonstrated the involvement of TR in this T3 action .
4) Proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta are likely involved in this disease , but are also known to inhibit thyroid hormone receptor ( TR ) - beta1 gene expression , which is of interest as the D1 promoter contains TREs .
5) Included are genes that are implicated in the eel 's somatic growth ( insulin-like growth factor 1 and thyroid hormone receptor beta ) , osmoregulation ( Na + / K + - ATPase beta1 and aquaporin 3 ) , and hematopoiesis ( hemoglobin alpha-chain ) .
6) In CV-1 cells transfected with wild-type ( wt ) nuclear thyroid hormone receptor TRbeta1 ( TR ) , L-thyroxine ( T ( 4 ) ) causes activation and nuclear translocation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK , ERK1/2 ) , co-immunoprecipitation of MAPK and TR , and MAPK-dependent serine phosphorylation of TR .
7) To understand whether the transcriptional activity of thyroid hormone nuclear receptors ( TRs ) is modulated by cell-type specific factors , full length TR subtype alpha1 ( TRalpha1 ) and beta1 ( TRbeta1 ) cDNAs were cloned from human hepatoma cell lines : HA22T , SK-Hep-1 and HepG2 .
8) The expression of transcription factors , such as thyroid hormone receptor-beta1 ( TRbeta1 ) , and transcriptional co-repressors , such as histone deactylase 3 ( HDAC3 ) , was affected by Delta9-THC in a dose-dependent manner , whereby 15 microM Delta9-THC caused a 2.8-fold inhibition of TRbeta1 expression , but a 3.5-fold increase in HDAC3 expression .

What types of DNA mutations are induced by 2-hydroxy-dATP ( 2-OH-dATP ) ?
0) The mutation induced by 2-OH-dATP but not that induced by 8-OH-dGTP occurred less frequently in the dinB strain than in the wild-type wt strain suggesting the involvement of pol IV in the mutagenesis by 2-OH-dATP
1) Results indicate that DNA polymerase eta incorporates 2-hydroxy-dATP opposite template G in addition to template T and 8-hydroxy-dGTP opposite A in addition to C respectively
2) Induction of mutations by N-acetoxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene modified M13 viral DNA
3) Acetaldehyde is a highly reactive compound that causes various forms of damage to DNA including DNA adducts single and/or double-strand breaks DSBs point mutations sister chromatid exchanges SCEs and DNA-DNA cross-links
4) The metabolism of estradiol can cause DNA damage in two ways a formation of estradiol-adenine guanine adducts which are released from the DNA backbone leaving depurinated sites which undergo error prone DNA repair and mutations and b generation of oxygen free radicals resulting from redox cycling of 4-OH estradiol to the 3-4 estradiol quinone and back conversion to 4-OH estradiol
5) To elucidate the behavior of DNA polymerase eta against the oxidized purine nucleotides we determined the utilization efficiency of 2-hydroxy-dATP and 8-hydroxy-dGTP by the recombinant yeast DNA polymerase eta using the primer extension assay with the synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers and compared those by DNA polymerase alpha
6) To reveal the roles of Y family DNA polymerases in the mutagenesis induced by oxidatively damaged DNA precursors 2-hydroxy-dATP 2-OH-dATP and 8-hydroxy-dGTP 8-OH-dGTP were introduced into Escherichia coli strains deficient in the Y family polymerases DNA polymerase IV pol IV encoded by the dinB gene and DNA polymerase V pol V encoded by the umuDC locus
7) These results indicate that the misinsertion specificity of 2-OH-dATP differs between replicative and repair-type DNA polymerases and provide a biochemical basis for the mutations induced by 2-OH-dATP in E. coli
8) To study the mechanisms of mutagenesis by the carcinogen 1,8-dinitropyrene we have determined the DNA adducts formed and mutations induced by its partially activated metabolite 1-nitroso-8-nitropyrene 1,8-NONP in an Escherichia coli strain deficient in nucleotide excision-repair

Can botulism poisoning of a pregnant woman harm her fetus ?
0) Although thousands of people in the world each year continue to be poisoned with botulinum toxin-food-borne infantile or wound botulism-the neurotoxin is now sufficiently understood to allow it to be used as a medicinal agent to paralyze specific muscles giving temporary symptomatic relief from a variety of dystonic neurologic disorders
1) Eighty years after Kerner 's work in 1895 a botulism outbreak after a funeral dinner with smoked ham in the small Belgian village of Ellezelles led to the discovery of the pathogen Clostridium botulinum by Emile Pierre van Ermengem Professor of bacteriology at the University of Ghent

What are the reported adverse effects of topical minoxidil ?
0) To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to report the effect of low-dose daily aspirin use on the efficacy of topical minoxidil .
1) These findings indicate that in AA the reduction in perifollicular T-cell infiltration associated with CAHR is not attributable to an effect of topical minoxidil .
2) Conditions for which the use of topical minoxidil has been reported include telogen effluvium , alopecia areata ( AA ) , scarring alopecia , eyebrow hypotrichosis , monilethrix , and chemotherapy-induced alopecia ( CIA ) .
3) The purpose of this study was to determine if the penetration enhancer SEPA ( 2-n-nonyl-1 ,3 - dioxolane ) would augment the scalp hair growth effects of topical minoxidil in the balding stumptail macaque .
4) While topical minoxidil is not very effective for those with 100 % scalp hair loss , it is an effective , easy and safe treatment for those with AA affecting 25-99 % of the scalp .
5) We report a woman whose hair loss progressed while using spironolactone and topical minoxidil in combination , but reversed with flutamide , a potent androgen receptor antagonist .

--------------------
Which cellular processes are regulated by Nanog ?
0) Ancillary to BMP4 and BMP7 classical stem cell proteins e.g. SOX2 NANOG OCT3/4 and GBX2 are regulated by LIF
1) NANOG one of homeobox proteins plays a crucial role in regulating self-renewal and pluripotency for embryonic stem cells ESCs
2) We suggest that BRACHYURY may regulate NANOG in mesenchymal-like CRC cells to impose a plastic-state allowing competence of cells to respond to signals prompting invasion or metastasis
3) BRACHYURY itself regulated by the oncogene β-catenin influences NANOG and other stemness markers including a panel of markers defining CRC-CSC whose presence has been linked to poor patient prognosis
4) We have recently employed a proteomics approach to explore the regulatory protein networks in which Nanog a fundamental ES cell transcription factor operates and have constructed the first protein interaction network in mouse ES cells
5) Understanding molecular mechanisms by which Nanog functions should illuminate fundamental properties of stem cells and the process of cellular reprogramming
6) Here we identified that lysine demethylase KDM3A as a critical regulator of ovarian cancer stemness and cisplatin resistance by inducing the expressions of pluripotent molecules Sox2 and Nanog and anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 Bcl-2 respectively
7) An application of D-NEMs to embryonic stem cell development in mice reveals a feed-forward loop dominated network which stabilizes the differentiated state of cells and points to Nanog as the key sensitizer of stem cells for differentiation stimuli
8) The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs from somatic cells by expressing ectopic reprogramming transcriptional factors such as Oct3/4 Sox2 Klf4 c-Myc and Nanog is one of the cutting-edge discoveries in stem cell and cancer research
9) In this way we established pluripotency-differentiation boundaries between Nanog expressing cells pluripotency zone and Nanog suppressed cells early differentiation zone within the same cell population with a gradient of Nanog expression across the individual cell colonies to serve as a mimic of the developmental process
--------------------
What is the treatment of Riedel disease ( thyroiditis ) ?
0) In 1796 , an English country physician , Edward Jenner , discovered that inoculating mankind with cowpox can protect them from smallpox ( Riedel S , Edward Jenner and the history of smallpox and vaccination .
1) The fibrosclerosing disorders of retroperitoneal fibrosis , sclerosing mediastinitis , sclerosing cholangitis , orbital pseudotumor , and Riedel thyroiditis are seemingly related in a clinical sense because there are well-documented cases of patients with two or more of these conditions and reports of these disorders presenting in family members .
2) Pestiviruses are a genus within the family Flaviviridae that affect cloven-hoofed animals , causing economically important diseases like classical swine fever ( CSF ) and bovine viral diarrhea ( BVD ) .
3) Clinically it is impossible to distinguish between Riedel 's / thyroiditis and other diseases as undifferentiated carcinoma , Hashimoto 's disease etc. .
4) Lesions of the thyroid with infiltrating plasma cells include HT , fibrous variant of HT , plasmacytoma , plasma cell myeloma , Riedel thyroiditis , IgG4 ( immunoglobulin G4 ) - related disease , IMT , and PCG .
5) This new disease entity includes a wide variety of diseases such as Mikulicz disease , autoimmune pancreatitis , Riedel thyroiditis , interstitial nephritis and retroperitoneal fibrosis .
6) The term autoimmune pancreatitis ( AIP ) was first used in Japan in 1995 to describe a newly recognized form of chronic pancreatitis , after the description of Yoshida and colleagues .
7) Recently published International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria for Autoimmune Pancreatitis include Guidelines of the International Association of Pancreatology , classifying AIP into types 1 and 2 , using five cardinal features of AIP , namely imaging of pancreatic parenchyma and duct , serology , other organ involvement , pancreatic histology , and an optional criterion of response to steroid therapy .
8) Although sclerosing mesenteritis is often associated with other idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as retroperitoneal fibrosis , sclerosing cholangitis , Riedel thyroiditis , and orbital pseudotumor , its exact cause is unknown .
9) By considering Barrett , Hayward , Riedel and Ruol 's studies , they maintain that the fundamental factor which causes the development of cardial adenocarcinoma is the gastroesophageal reflux .
--------------------
Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of facultative heterochromatin ?
0) How post-translational histone modifications regulate DNA utilization constitutes one of the central questions of chromatin biology
1) Mutations in genes that are important in epigenetic regulation by influencing DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications have long been associated with neuronal disorders in humans such as Rett syndrome Huntington 's disease and some forms of mental retardation and recent work has focused on unravelling their mechanisms of action
2) To detect relative accumulations or losses of constitutive post-translational histone modifications in chromatin regions surrounding DNA double-strand breaks DSB we developed a method based on ion microirradiation and correlation of the signal intensities after immunofluorescence detection of the histone modification in question and the DSB marker γ-H2AX
3) Key epigenetic players are DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications which interplay with each other with regulatory proteins and with non-coding RNAs to remodel chromatin into domains such as euchromatin constitutive or facultative heterochromatin and to achieve nuclear compartmentalization
4) Although post-translational histone modifications are believed to have an important role in modulating transcriptional regulation of UVB-induced COX-2 the underlying biochemical mechanisms are completely unknown
5) Our data reveal that variants of the NURF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that recognize post-translational histone modifications are important regulators of primary spermatocyte differentiation in Drosophila
6) Two major mechanisms that cause epigenetic changes are post-translational histone modifications and DNA methylation at cytosine bases within a CpG dinucleotide
7) Epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications such as histone de acetylation histone methylation and histone sumoylation were identified as regulatory mechanisms in controlling aggressive cell activation in vitro and in disease outcome in animal models in vivo
8) For example mapping of open chromatin regions post-translational histone modifications and DNA methylation across a whole genome is now feasible and new non-coding regulatory RNAs can be sensitively identified via RNA sequencing
9) Deregulation of key epigenetic factors and chromatin-modifying proteins particularly those responsible for the addition removal or recognition of post-translational histone modifications are frequently found in human pancreatic cancer and hence constitute particularly exciting treatment opportunities
--------------------
Which cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor is regulated by Bmi-1 ?
0) Expression of cyclin dependent kinase Cdk inhibitor p27 Kip1 which blocks cell cycle progression from G 1 to S phase can be regulated via multiple mechanisms including transcription protein degradation and translation
1) The Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CYC202 R-roscovitine inhibits retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation causes loss of Cyclin D1 and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway
2) Recently two cell cycle regulators that inhibit the cyclin D1-associated kinases cdk4 and cdk6 have been identified p16 and p15 the products of the INK4A also known as CDKN2 MTS1 and INK4B also known as MTS2 putative tumor suppressor genes located on 9p21
3) Energy balance and the AKT pathway are important in colorectal cancer development and regulate p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1B CDKN1B/KIP1 which plays a role in preventing cell cycle progression
4) The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 CIP1/WAF1 and p16 INK4a govern the G 1 S cell cycle checkpoint and are essential for determining whether a cell enters into an arrested state
5) GAT-1 deficiency promotes T cell division and survival by down-regulating cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27 kip1 differentially regulating the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 Bcl-xl and Bad and activating transcription factor NF-kappaB through induction of translocation and phosphorylation of protein kinase C PKC theta
6) We show that cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf1/cip1 that inhibits cell proliferation is down-regulated in conjunction with up-regulation of c-fos in the lymphocytes of patients with RA
7) Disruption of Suv4-20h1 expression induced Garrest in the cell cycle and increased expression levels of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A p21 an essential cell cycle protein involved in checkpoint regulation
8) Costimulation through ICAM-1 also had an effect similar to costimulation through CD28 in its ability to down-regulate the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1
9) LMP1 induces the expression of two members of the family of Id proteins Id1 and Id3 and affects cell cycle regulation by decreasing the expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and increasing levels and phosphorylation of cdk2 and Rb
--------------------
Can RNAPolII function as an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase ?
0) DNA-dependent RNA polymerases RNApol are Zn2 metalloproteins where the Zn2 ion plays both catalytic and structural roles
1) Lentivirus-based gene delivery vectors carrying multiple gene cassettes are powerful tools in gene transfer studies and gene therapy allowing coexpression of multiple therapeutic factors and if desired fluorescent reporters
2) We show that RNA polymerase II RNAPolII preinitiation complex recruitment and H3 Lys 4 H3-K4 methylation at the Xist promoter form the basis of the Xist expression profiles that drives both imprinted and random XCI
3) In this study we describe a novel vector design that facilitates combined expression of therapeutic RNA and protein-based antiangiogenic factors as well as a fluorescent reporter from back-to-back RNApolII-driven expression cassettes
4) RNApolII-dependent transcription is repressed in primordial germ cells of many animals during early development and is thought to be important for maintenance of germline fate by preventing somatic differentiation
5) As such RNAa can be a valuable approach for therapeutic treatment of the FOXG1-haploinsufficiency-linked variant of the Rett syndrome
6) Enhancing Neuronogenesis and Counteracting Neuropathogenic Gene Haploinsufficiencies by RNA Gene Activation
7) A noncoding RNA is required for the repression of RNApolII-dependent transcription in primordial germ cells
8) Purified EAP showed a histone H3 lysine 79-specific methylase activity displayed a robust RNAPolII CTD kinase function and counteracted the effect of the pTEFb inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-benzimidazole-riboside
9) In order to check whether the presence of Zn2 ions has any effect on substrate recognition we followed the binding of gamma-AmNS UTP a fluorescent substrate analog to RNApolII
--------------------
List proteins of lipids droplets
0) Most mammalian cells package neutral lipids into droplets that are surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and a specific set of proteins including the adipose differentiation-related protein ADRP also called adipophilin which is found in a wide array of cell types and the perilipins which are restricted to adipocytes and steroidogenic cells
1) The cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector CIDE family has been characterized as the lipid droplet proteins involved in the metabolism of lipid storage droplets
2) In mammalian cells lipid storage droplets contain a triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer into which a number of proteins are imbedded
3) The major cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-kinase substrate in adipocytes is perilipin a protein found exclusively at the surface of the lipid storage droplets
4) Cytoskeletal proteins found on CE droplets influence droplet lipid composition and maturation in model foam cells
5) The perilipins are a family of polyphosphorylated proteins found exclusively surrounding neutral lipid storage droplets in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells
6) The droplets consist of neutral lipids mostly triacylglycerides and cholesterol esters
7) Intracellular neutral lipid storage droplets are essential organelles of eukaryotic cells yet little is known about the proteins at their surfaces or about the amino acid sequences that target proteins to these storage droplets
8) Perilipins are a family of unique proteins intimately associated with the limiting surface of neutral lipid storage droplets in adipocytes and in steroidogenic cells
9) Although a link between excess lipid storage and aberrant glucose metabolism has been recognized for many years little is known what role lipid storage droplets and associated proteins such as Plin2 play in managing cellular glucose levels
--------------------
Is Calcium homeostasis important in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology ?
0) Both RyR2 and calsequestrin are important participants in the cardiac cellular calcium homeostasis
1) Transmembrane sodium Na fluxes and intracellular sodium homeostasis are central players in the physiology of the cardiac myocyte since they are crucial for both cell excitability and for the regulation of the intracellular calcium concentration
2) The concept that sex hormones may regulate intracellular calcium at the level of the cardiomyocyte is important as levels of these hormones decline in both men and women as the incidence of cardiovascular disease rises
3) This calcium-activated monovalent selective cation channel also plays a key role in cardiovascular pathophysiology for example a mutation in the TRPM4 channel leads to cardiac conduction disease
4) Epigenetic modification has emerged in recent years as a major influence cardiac physiology and histone acetyl transferases HATs and histone deacetylases HDACs are now known to both induce and antagonize hypertrophic growth
5) Calcium is involved in many facets of neuronal physiology including activity growth and differentiation synaptic plasticity and learning and memory as well as pathophysiology including necrosis apoptosis and degeneration
6) In the cardiovascular system T-type calcium channels play an important role for the intracellular calcium homeostasis and spontaneous pacemaker activity and are involved in the progression of structural heart diseases
7) This allows the receptor to play diverse and crucial roles in human physiology and pathophysiology both in calcium homeostasis and in tissues and biological processes unrelated to calcium balance
8) Recent evidence suggests that this arises from sex differences in components of the cardiac excitation-contraction coupling pathway the sequence of events linking myocyte depolarization to calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent contraction
9) Ca2 homeostasis is maintained by proteins of the outer cell membrane or sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum which is the major intracellular Ca2 storage organelle
--------------------
Do proton pump inhibitors affect thyroxine absorption ?
0) Proton-pump inhibitors antacids and a long list of drugs may decrease thyroxine absorption
1) Other drugs can alter T4 absorption T4 and T3 transport in serum and metabolism of T4 and T3 such as proton-pump inhibitors and antacids estrogens mitotane and fluorouracil phenobarbital and rifampin
2) Proton pump inhibitors PPIs in general may alter the absorption of drugs by increasing the intragastric pH. Due to the presence of an imidazole ring the PPIs of the class of substituted benzimidazole sulfoxides may interfere with the metabolism of other drugs by altering the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system via either induction or inhibition
3) For over a decade despite animal and human studies and numerous case reports that demonstrated interference by proton pump inhibitors PPIs with enteric absorption of dietary and medicinal iron the importance of this effect in clinical practice has remained uncertain 1 2
4) Potential areas of concern that have been raised in the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors which could alter this risk-benefit ratio include gastric carcinoid formation the development of rebound acid hypersecretion when proton pump inhibitor treatment is stopped the development of tolerance increased oxyntic gastritis in H. pylori patients and the possibility of increasing the risk of gastric cancer the possible stimulation of growth of non-gastric tumours due to hypergastrinaemia and the possible effect of the hypo/achlorhydria on nutrient absorption particularly iron and vitamin B12
5) While proton pump inhibitors appear to have some direct effect on H. pylori and extreme hypochlorhydria has a deleterious effect on the organism the most likely mechanism by which antisecretory drugs as a class provide this effect is by improving the efficacy of the antibiotics themselves
6) In order to achieve more potent rapid and sustained acid inhibition several compounds are currently under development such as new proton pump inhibitors with a prolonged plasma half-life potassium competitive ATPase blockers PCABs histamine H3 agonists and gastrin antagonists
7) Proton pump inhibitors also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux or with the cytochrome P450 CYP enzyme system e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance
8) The authors propose that PPIs such as omeprazole may interfere with iron absorption in certain patients and that a subpopulation of patients who develop significant iron deficiency characterized by low serum ferritin levels while on PPIs may also develop RLS-like symptoms including RLSAP
9) The absorption of some compounds e.g. benzylpenicillin penicillin G are altered during treatment with proton pump inhibitors as a result of the increased intragastric pH. A synergy has been confirmed between omeprazole and amoxicillin or clarithromycin in the antibacterial effect against Helicobacter pylori
--------------------
Are thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 mutations implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome ?
0) We have identified a novel nonsense mutation in codon 449 in the 3 end of exon 10 in the TR beta gene in a 16-year-old male patient with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone who also had familial thyroxine binding globulin deficiency
1) Since no patient with a mutant TRalpha has been identified we introduced a point mutation into the mouse thyroid hormone receptor TRalpha1 locus originally found in the TRbeta gene that reduces ligand binding 10-fold
2) Our results indicate that TRalpha1 is involved in the regulation of hippocampal structure and function and raise the possibility that deletions or mutations of this receptor isoform may lead to behavioral changes or even psychiatric syndromes in humans
3) The thyroid hormone resistance syndrome diabetes obesity and some types of cancer are just a few examples of important diseases that are related to TR malfunctioning particularly impaired hormone binding
4) Mutations in the thyroid hormone TH binding region of the TH beta-receptor TRbeta that eliminate its TH-binding ability lead to the thyroid hormone resistance syndrome RTH in humans which is characterized by high blood TH levels goiter hyperactivity and tachycardia
5) These findings suggested that DNA-binding and receptor dimerization are important for dominant negative inhibition by the mutant TR which is responsible for thyroid hormone resistance in a heterozygous patient with a point mutation in the TR beta gene
6) Resistance to thyroid hormone RTH is a rare disorder characterized by variable tissue hyporesponsiveness to thyroid hormone usually caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta TRbeta
7) These findings indicate that mutant beta receptors in patients with thyroid hormone resistance have reduced affinity for T3 and are functionally deficient but impair the activity of normal receptors thereby providing a mechanism for the dominant mode of inheritance in this disorder
8) We have identified 20 different mutations in the thyroid hormone beta-receptor TR beta gene in RTH and assayed mutant receptor properties using the TSH alpha subunit gene promoter or promoters containing three different types of positive thyroid response element TRE
9) A novel mutation of thyroid hormone receptor beta I431V impairs corepressor release and induces thyroid hormone resistance syndrome
--------------------
The antibodies MK-3475 and CT-011 have shown promising results in treating malignancies . Which protein are they targeting ?
0) The PD-1 / PD-L1 axis modulates the natural killer cell versus multiple myeloma effect : a therapeutic target for CT-011 , a novel monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody .
1) Agents currently in active clinical development for lung cancer include ipilimumab , which modulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 pathway , and multiple agents targeting the programmed death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) pathway , both anti-PD-1 compounds ( nivolumab , pembrolizumab [ MK-3475 ] ) and those that target programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) , a key ligand for PD-1 ( BMS-936559 , MPDL3280A ) .
2) Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G4κ class directed against the immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein-1 ( PD-1 ) .
3) This has led to the development of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) , a highly selective , humanized monoclonal IgG4-kappa isotype antibody against PD-1 .
4) Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor on T cells and prevents binding to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 .
5) In Phase I clinical trials , two anti-PD1 therapies , Nivolumab and MK-3475 , that block the PD-1 receptor to enable T cell killing have demonstrated objective tumor responses in patients with advanced melanoma .
6) Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 , lambrolizumab , Keytruda ( ® ) ) is a PD-1 inhibitor that has shown clinical activity in a variety of solid tumors and is currently approved for the second-line treatment of PD-L1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer and for unresectable/metastatic melanoma .
7) Finally , the impact of pembrolizumab in NSCLC is growing as evidenced by the numerous , ongoing trials open for combinations with chemotherapy , chemoradiation , other immunotherapeutics , immunomodulators , tyrosine kinase inhibitors , PI3K inhibitors , MEK inhibitors , hypomethylating agents , and histone deacetylase inhibitors .
8) Programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) and its ligands , programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) and 2 ( PD-L2 ) play an important role in regulating immune response through various mechanisms .
9) The Monascus product known as red mold rice ( RMR ) has been found to contain the cholesterol-lowering agent monacolin K ( MK ) , including the lactone form ( MKL ) and the acid form ( MKA ) and mycotoxin citrinin ( CT ) .
--------------------
From which sequence does the Alu repeat originate from ?
0) Some of the Alu sequences are arranged in tandems of two or three which seem to originate from insertions of younger Alu sequences into the poly A region of previously integrated Alu sequences as indicated by flanking direct repeats
1) The analysis of the Alu sequences and their flanking direct repeat sequences suggest that an ancestral genomic structure has been maintained in the GPA gene whereas the GPB gene has arisen from the acquisition of 3 sequences different from those of the GPA gene by homologous recombination at the Alu repeats during or after gene duplication
2) This suggests that a recombination event took place here and that an Alu repeat sequence that is known to have characteristics of transposable elements played some role in a recombination or gene conversion event
3) There are several sequence similarities between the dhfr rhodopsin origin regions including common transcription promoter consensus sequences rodent Alu repeats with their 3 A+T rich flanking sequences A+T rich yeast ARS and Drosophila SAR consensus sequences and simple GA n repeats but there are no extended regions of direct similarity
4) The conservation of this novel arrangement among the higher primates suggests that an inserted Alu family repeat and its flanking genomic sequence have co-evolved for at least 30 million years to provide the canonical CCAAT and TATA promoter elements of the theta 1 globin genes in higher primates
5) Based on the finding from bioinformatic analysis that Alu repeats represent 85 of LDLR intronic sequences outside exon-intron junctions we designed a strategy to improve the exploration of genomic regions in the vicinity of exons in 110 FH subjects from an admixed population
6) With a probe containing Alu repeat sequences Pääbo isolated a 3.4-kilobase DNA fragment from a 2,400-year-old Egyptian mummy which was subsequently shown to contain an intron of the nuclear gene HLA-DQA ref
7) An Alu repeat sequence was identified in the first intron of the human D4 gene but is not present in the rat D4 gene
8) piBLUR clones are able to retrieve human clones from such libraries because at least one Alu family repeat is present on most 15 to 20 kb fragments of human DNA and because of the relative species-specificity of the sequences comprising the Alu family
9) The most 3 splice donor site of exon 1A is found within an Alu repeat sequence
--------------------
How is mTORC1 involved in the regulation of heat stress ?
0) Together these findings define a novel molecular mechanism whereby heat stress induces PI3K/mTORC2-dependent AKT survival signaling in HCC cells and provide a mechanistic rationale for adjuvant AKT inhibition in combination with thermal ablation as a strategy to enhance HCC cell killing and prevent local recurrence particularly at the ablation margin
1) Inhibition of both mTOR and PIM counteracted induction of heat-shock family proteins uncovering the master negative regulation of heat shock factor 1 HSF1 the dominant transcription factor controlling cellular stress responses
2) HSF-1 is involved in regulation of ascaroside pheromone biosynthesis by heat stress in Caenorhabditis elegans
3) OsHIRP1 is an E3 ligase that acts as a positive regulator in the plant response to heat stress thus providing important information relating to adaptation and regulation under heat stress in plant
4) These results show that in MDCK cells preconditioning heat stress-induced HSPs are not involved in the regulation of Na K Cl and Na P i cotransporters and do not protect them from modulation by severe heat stress
5) Exposure to sublethal heat stress activates a complex cascade of signaling events such as activators NO signal molecules PKCε and mediators HSP70 and COX-2 leading to implementation of heat preconditioning an adaptive mechanism which makes the organism more tolerant to additional stress
6) Here we report that the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR regulates the diffusion of Xrn2 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm facilitating the degradation of iMet under conditions of heat stress
7) By screening the profiling data for genes in biochemical pathways in which known HSF targets were involved we discovered that at each step in the pathway leading to osmolytes the expression of genes is regulated by heat stress and in several cases by HSF
8) In summary these results support the novel concept that heat stress inhibits the Akt pathway by dissociating PDK-1 from its chaperone Hsp90 leading to potentiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in resistant malignant cells
9) Therefore this work provides evidence indicating that Tpk2 and Tpk3 have opposing roles in translational adaptation during heat stress and highlight how the same signaling pathway can be regulated to generate strikingly distinct physiological outputs
--------------------
Which myosin isozymes are located within the pericuticular necklace of the hair cell ?
0) The myosin isozymes expressed in the hair cell all have unique domains of expression and in some areas such as the pericuticular necklace several domains overlap
1) Type B cells the predominant hair cell type in the utricular macula are small cells with short sterocilia and kinocilia 2-6 times as long as their longest stereocilia
2) Substantial amounts of myosins-Ibeta VI and VIIa are located in a pericuticular necklace that is largely free of F-actin squeezed between but not associated with actin of the cuticular plate and the circumferential belt
3) Silvery hair is a common presentation of rare group of autosomal recessive disorders called Silvery hair syndromes including Griscelli syndrome GS Chediak-Higashi syndrome and Elejalde syndrome
4) To understand how cells differentially use the dozens of myosin isozymes present in each genome we examined the distribution of four unconventional myosin isozymes in the inner ear a tissue that is particularly reliant on actin-rich structures and unconventional myosin isozymes
5) Using immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation experiments we showed in bullfrog sacculus that PMCA1b is the major isozyme of hair cell and supporting cell basolateral membranes and that PMCA2a is the only PMCA present in hair bundles
6) As suggested previously myosin-Ibeta probably plays a role in adaptation concentration of myosin-VI in cuticular plates and association with stereociliary rootlets suggest that this isozyme participates in rigidly anchoring stereocilia and finally colocalization with cross-links between adjacent stereocilia indicates that myosin-VIIa is required for the structural integrity of hair bundles
7) Root hair a special type of tubular-shaped cell outgrows from the root epidermal cell and plays important roles in the acquisition of nutrients and water as well as interactions with biotic and abiotic stresses
8) Recent work has demonstrated the presence of several myosin isozymes in hair bundles confirmed that bundles display myosin ATPase activity and shown that the work performed by myosin molecules could account for one aspect of the amplificatory process
9) Linearizing the nullclines and assuming perfect time-scale separation between the variables we can map the FitzHugh-Nagumo system to a simple two-state model in which each of the states corresponds to the two possible values of the binary-filtered hair bundle trajectory
--------------------
Are nucleosomes positioned at DNA replication origins ?
0) Together our data provide a comprehensive genome-wide view of chromatin structure at replication origins and suggest a model of nucleosome positioning at replication origins in which the underlying sequence occludes nucleosomes to permit binding of the origin recognition complex which then likely in concert with nucleosome modifiers and remodelers positions nucleosomes adjacent to the origin to promote replication origin function
1) The availability of genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions has led to an explosion of information about how nucleosomes are assembled at transcription start sites but no similar maps exist for DNA replication origins
2) The EcoRI CIV DNA fragment M 7.1 kb 0.310-0 .345 map units harbors one out of at least six loci of DNA replication origins which is located at nucleotide position 485-513
3) On average replication origins contain a nucleosome depleted region centered next to the ACS element flanked on both sides by arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes
4) Here we combine high-resolution genome-wide nucleosome maps with comprehensive annotations of DNA replication origins to identify patterns of nucleosome occupancy at eukaryotic replication origins
5) Using lambda DNA we show that DNA replication origins are activated in clusters in regions that contain closely spaced adenine or thymine asymmetric tracks used as preferential initiation sites
6) B19V replication follows a model of rolling hairpin-dependent DNA replication in which the large nonstructural protein NS1 introduces a site-specific single-strand nick in the viral DNA replication origins which locate at the ITRs
7) The DNA replication origins of metazoan genomes are the sites of complex sequence-specific protein-DNA interactions determining their precise cycle of activation and deactivation once only along each cell cycle
8) Data obtained show that antiviral activities of bis-linked netropsin derivatives are targeted by specific complexes formed by helicase UL9 of herpes simplex virus type 1 with viral DNA replication origins represented by two OriS sites and one OriL site
9) The current evidence suggests that transcription factors bind to auxiliary sequences adjacent to replication origins and recruit chromatin remodeling factors to create either nucleosome-free regions or regions of specifically spaced nucleosomes

Name five programs for transcript quantification from RNASeq experiments
0) By combining differential measurements with resolving power to detect DEGs the LSTNR method offers an alternative approach to interrogate noisy and low-replication RNAseq datasets which handles multiple biological conditions at once and defines benchmarks to validate RNAseq experiments with standard benchtop assays
1) To study larval performance and transcriptomic responses to host and non-host plants we conducted developmental assays and replicated RNAseq experiments with Manduca larvae fed on different Solanaceous plants as well as on a Brassicaceous non-host plant Brassica napus

7) This chapter provides hand-on tools and a step-by-step procedure to analyze RNASeq data from punctures of two different retinal tissues retina and RPE-choroid-sclera at two different locations periphery and macular region from eight individuals
8) To handle such information sharing in a rigorous manner we propose an hierarchical empirical Bayes approach R-EBSeq that combines the Cufflinks model for generating relative transcript abundance measurements known as FPKM fragments per kilobase of transcript length per million mapped reads with the EBArrays framework which was previously developed for empirical Bayes analysis of microarray data
9) To life scientists one important feature offered by RNAseq a next-generation sequencing tool used to estimate changes in gene expression levels lies in its unprecedented resolution

Which thyroid hormone transporter is implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome ?
0) One producing severe psychomotor defects in 100 males from 26 families is caused by mutations in the cell-membrane transporter of TH MCT8 the second affecting the intracellular metabolism of TH in four individuals from two families is caused by mutations in the SECISBP2 gene which is required for the synthesis of selenoproteins including TH deiodinases
1) Mutations in the TRbeta gene cell membrane transporter and genes controlling intracellular metabolism of thyroid hormone have been implicated
2) By dividing a hormone 's receptors into central and peripheral pools the former of which may not be part of the hormone 's negative feed back loop the BBB fosters the development of variable hormone resistance syndromes as exemplified by evidence that altered insulin action in the CNS can contribute to Alzheimer 's disease
3) The mechanism of thyroid hormone action has been informed by these clinical observations as well as by animal models and has influenced the way we view the role of local ligand availability tissue and cell-specific thyroid hormone transporters corepressors and coactivators thyroid hormone receptor TR isoform-specific action and cross-talk in metabolic regulation and neural development

2) Topoisomerase II activity involved in cleaving DNA into topological domains is altered in a multiple drug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line .
3) Chinese hamster ovary SMR16 cells are apparently resistant to topoisomerase II poisons because the topoisomerase II that defines the DNA topological domains is either decreased in amount or insensitive to drug action .

5) YY146 , an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody , was employed as a targeting molecule to which we conjugated the zwitterionic near-infrared fluorescence ( NIRF ) dye ZW800-1 and the chelator deferoxamine ( Df ) .
6) Pretreatment of neutrophils with a monoclonal antibody to CD18 , β chain of lymphocyte function-associated molecule 1 ( LFA-1 ) , or an Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor before incubation with the highly leukotoxic strain inhibited the release of resistin .
7) Although daratumumab , a CD38 monoclonal antibody , has established its efficacy as a single agent and in combination with immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors , elotuzumab ( signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 monoclonal antibody ) has proven activity in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone .

--------------------
Which are the main histone modifications associated with enhancers ?
0) The coexistence of high mono-methylation and low tri-methylation levels of lysine 4 of histone H3 is considered a signature of enhancers but a comprehensive view of histone modifications associated to enhancers is still lacking
1) Features that are associated with enhancer activity such as regulatory factor binding or histone modifications can predict the location of enhancers
2) Based on ChIP-seq analysis of enhancer-associated histone modifications including H3K4 methylation and H3K9 acetylation we discovered several potential enhancers for one of which was located 16kb upstream of the gene 's transcriptional start site
3) The organization of the genome into functional units such as enhancers and active or repressed promoters is associated with distinct patterns of DNA and histone modifications
4) Formation of nucleosome free region NFR accompanied by specific histone modifications at flanking nucleosomes is an important prerequisite for enhancer and promoter activity
5) We propose that both transcription initiation and the H3K4me3 histone modification are among the best hallmarks of active enhancers in several primary tissues and extend the concept of large transcription initiation platforms TIPs
6) We show further that the ability of YY1 to regulate CPC phenotype is associated with its ability to modulate histone modifications specifically at a developmentally critical enhancer of Nkx2-5 and other key cardiac transcription factor such as Tbx5
7) Studying levels of H3K4me3 a histone modification at sites such as promoters enhancers and recombination hotspots we found tissue-specific-regulation of H3K4me3 levels in four highly diverse cell types male germ cells embryonic stem cells hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes
8) Thanks to the recent technological advances to map histone modifications and chromatin-associated factors genome-wide several studies have begun to characterize chromatin signatures of active enhancers
9) Using PARE on ChIP-seq histone modifications from four ENCODE cell lines and four hematopoietic differentiation stages we identified several enhancers whose regulatory activity is stage specific and correlates positively with the expression of proximal genes in a particular stage
--------------------
What is the enzymatic activity of the breast cancer associated gene BRCA1 ?
0) Cytokines that are up-regulated after ischemia , like interleukin ( IL ) -10 , can induce HO-1 gene expression , which is positively regulated by the transcriptional activator nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) and negatively regulated by the transcriptional repressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein ( BRCA1 ) associated C-terminal helicase 1 ( Bach-1 ) .
1) The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is an important genetic factor in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and there is increasing evidence of an important role for BRCA1 in the sporadic forms of both cancer types .
2) The recent cloning of a breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA1 ) , and determination of the locus of a related gene ( BRCA2 ) , offers potential for clinical genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility .
3) The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 , is a nuclear phosphoprotein which functions as a tumor suppressor in human breast cancer cells .
4) Clinical studies suggest that the mRNA expression level of excision repair cross complementing group 1 gene ( ERCC1 ) is associated with epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation and breast cancer susceptibility 1 gene ( BRCA1 ) mRNA expression in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .
5) Breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA1 ) is a nuclear phosphoprotein expressed in many nuclear processes , including stem cell regulator , DNA damage repair , recombination , transcription , ubiquitination , cell cycle checkpoint enforcement , and centrosome regulation .
6) These findings indicate that HOXA9 restricts breast tumor aggression by modulating expression of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 , which we believe provides an explanation for the loss of BRCA1 expression in sporadic breast tumors in the absence of BRCA1 genetic modifications .
7) Some of the genes that encode the kinases and ubiquitin ligases in this pathway are cancer predisposition genes , most prominently the breast cancer predisposition gene BRCA1 , which encodes a ubiquitin ligase .
8) A breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene , BRCA1 , which is responsible for disease in approximately 45 % of breast cancer families and most families that contain breast and ovarian cancer , has been assigned by genetic linkage to 17q12-21 .
9) Because BARD1 associates via its NH2-terminal RING domain with the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 that provides a platform for interactions with proteins involved in DNA repair and checkpoint control , our results provide a link between the Ewing 's sarcoma gene product and the genome surveillance complex .
--------------------
Is there any link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B ?

3) Members of the Aurora Polo and cyclin-dependent Cdk kinase families are known to regulate multiple events throughout cell division whereas another kinase citron kinase CIT-K for a long time has been considered to function solely during cytokinesis the last phase of cell division
4) Here we studied the effects of the pan-aurora kinase inhibitor tozasertib VX680 MK-0457 and the aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib MLN8237 that shows some specificity for aurora kinase A over aurora kinase B in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines with acquired drug resistance
5) To elucidate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs and Akt kinase in leukemogenesis caused by the breakpoint cluster region BCR Abelson ABL tyrosine kinase oncoprotein we examined the activities of MAPKs and Akt kinase and their roles in the action of STI571 a specific inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia CML cells
6) A key step in the activation of NF-kappaB is the phosphorylation of its inhibitor IkappaB alpha by a ubiquitination-inducible multiprotein kinase complex IkappaB alpha kinase
7) Recent studies show that flavonoids can bind directly to some protein kinases including Akt/protein kinase B Akt/PKB Fyn Janus kinase 1 JAK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 MEK1 phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase kinase 4 MKK4 Raf1 and zeta chain-associated 70-kDa protein ZAP-70 kinase and then alter their phosphorylation state to regulate multiple cell signaling pathways in carcinogenesis processes
8) New tyrosine kinase inhibitors include BCR-ABL kinase selective inhibitors dual ABL/SRC kinase inhibitors and aurora kinase inhibitors
9) Although most p53 protein kinases form p53-activating signals there are few kinases whose action can contribute to the inhibition of p53 as Casein kinase 1 CK1 and Checkpoint kinase 1 CHK1
--------------------
Is insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) able to affect tendon protein synthesis in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients ?
0) Insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) and IGF-II have powerful , well defined effects on osteoblastic cells , stimulating their proliferation and inducing collagen synthesis , but the role of IGF-I and - II in modulating osteoclast differentiation and activity remains unclear .
1) The relationship between insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) , a hormone which has potent metabolic effects and stimulates protein synthesis , and prolactin and oestradiol was examined to investigate a possible mechanism for the luteal cell hypertrophy that is responsible for the increase in size of the corpus luteum .
2) In animals insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) stimulates collagen production by fibroblasts and is expressed in tendons together with its binding protein 4 ( IGFBP-4 ) .
3) Earlier studies indicate that parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) enhances insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) synthesis in primary osteoblast-enriched fetal rat cell cultures and the stimulatory effect of PTH on bone collagen synthesis is mediated at least in part by IGF-I .
4) We have found that insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) , potent stimulator of collagen biosynthesis , induces prolidase activity in cultured human skin fibroblasts .
5) Insulin-like growth factor-I and - II ( IGF-I and IGF-II ) and/or the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IGF-IR ) have been implicated in a number of human tumors including breast cancer .
6) To elucidate a possible role for insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) in these events , porcine endometrial ( Days 8 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , and 30 ) and conceptus ( Days 12 , 14 , and 16 ) tissues were characterized for the presence of IGF-I peptide and mRNAs .
7) However , recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I ( rhIGF-I ) has now become commercially available as a therapeutic option to treat children of short stature caused by severe primary IGF-I deficiency , defined as : height standard deviation score ( SDS ) less than or equal to -3.0 , basal IGF-I SDS less than or equal to -3.0 , and normal or elevated levels of GH .
8) Parathyroid hormone-related peptide ( PTHrP ) and insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) are both involved in the regulation of bone and cartilage metabolisms and their interaction has been reported in osteoblasts .
9) IGF-I is an important stimulant of protein synthesis in muscle , but it also stimulates free fatty acid use .
--------------------
To what extent does HPV vaccination reduce the risk for cervical cancer ?
0) Since human papillomavirus HPV infection is the main risk factor for cervical cancer HPV vaccination is considered a promising strategy to prevent cervical cancer
1) We suggest that the recent introduction of voluntary HPV vaccination for girls in North America and elsewhere constitutes a form of neomedicalization Batt Lippman 2010 that links risks for future disease cervical cancer with the transmission of a common sexually transmitted infection HPV
2) As in other countries the HPV vaccination can be a cost-utility strategy to reduce the high burdens of cervical cancer in Peru a rapid and cheap HPV molecular sub-typification is rapidly required
3) The high burden of cervical cancer and the high efficacy and safety of HPV vaccination justify its introduction in the Indian NIP at the earliest possibility to substantially reduce the cervical cancer burden in future
4) As Black Hispanic and Asian populations continue to grow in the US over the next 40 y it is imperative that we not only improve HPV vaccination rates overall but focus on high-risk populations to prevent an increase in cervical cancer disparities
5) Governments of LMICs need enough convincing evidence that HPV vaccination will be more cost-effective in reducing the scourge of cervical cancer
6) The most common reasons for not accepting HPV vaccination were My daughter is too young to have risk of cervical cancer 30.95 The vaccine has not been widely used and the decision will be made after it is widely used 24.91 Worry about the safety of the vaccine 22.85
7) Targeting human papillomavirus HPV by prophylactic HPV vaccination in young adolescent girls and HPV-based screening in mid-adult women offers the most cost-effective strategy to reduce cervical cancer burden worldwide and mitigate the health disparities in cervical cancer burden between low-resourced and high-resourced settings
8) In this review we address five key myths HPV vaccination is not effective at preventing cancer Pap smears are sufficient to prevent cervical cancer HPV vaccination is not safe HPV vaccination is not needed since most infections are naturally cleared by the immune system 11-12 years of age is too young to vaccinate
9) Despite its efficacy in preventing cervical cancer HPV vaccination in females 49.5 and males 37.5 ages 13 through 17 falls well below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's CDC Healthy People 2020 target of 80 coverage

What is the role of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone in the treatment of comatose patients ?
0) Thyrotropin TSH releasing hormone TRH also known as thyroliberin was the first of a number of peptides exerting several roles as a hormone and as a neuropeptide
1) The maternal administration of betamethasone and thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH to accelerate the maturation of the fetus is an increasingly adopted strategy to prevent neonatal morbidity in preterm infants
2) Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone TRH pyroGlu-His-Pro-NH2 is important in the regulation of adenohypophyseal hormone secretion and also serves neurotropic functions in extra-hypothalamic brain areas indicating that it is involved in neurotransmission and other forms of cellular communication
3) The day after admission when methadone treatment was begun the PRL and TSH pituitary response to thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH 200 micrograms i.v. in 12 patients was studied
4) The role of thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH in the dorsal vagal complex DVC in mediating the enhanced gastric contractility induced by glutamate 100 pmol microinjected into the raphe pallidus Rpa was investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats acutely implanted with miniature strain gauge force transducers on the corpus of the stomach
5) Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH is primarily known as the central regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid HPT axis
6) Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH and its analogues have been shown to depolarise motoneurons and stimulate cyclical motor activities such as respiration and locomotion
7) To define a mechanism for the pressor effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone TRH we evaluated changes in mean blood pressure MBP when a synthetic form of TRH 0.1 mg/kg i.v. was injected into two types of comatose patients vegetative and brain dead
8) Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH causes hyperthermia in mice which is potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants nortriptyline imipramine clomipramine amitriptyline the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine and various other antidepressants maprotiline nomifensin viloxazine
9) Cerebrospinal fluid CSF corticotropin releasing hormone CRH somatostatin SRIF and thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH were measured by specific radioimmunoassay methods in 86 patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder and in 30 neurologic controls

Is Crohn 's disease ( CD ) linked to the consumption of refrigerated food ?
0) Decreased consumption of dietary fibers , such as cellulose , has been proposed to promote the emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBD : Crohn disease [ CD ] and ulcerative colitis [ UC ] ) where intestinal microbes are recognized to play an etiologic role .
1) Despite the fact that the true origin of ulcerative colitis and Crohn ´ s disease ( UC ) still remain elusive , basic as well as clinical research bring many new data on etiology and pathogenesis of this inflammatory condition .
2) Crohn ' s disease ( CD ) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder characterized by aberrant mucosal Th1 cell activation and production of IL-12 , the major Th1-driving factor .
3) Non-specific inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , including ulcerative colitis and Crohn ` s disease , is a chronic noninfectious inflammatory disease whose incidence is increasingly high , especially in the developed countries .
4) This disease includes three main types : Crohn & prime ; s disease ( CD ) , ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , and IBD-unclassified ( IBD-U ) .
5) A lack of gp96 protein in intestinal macrophages ( IMACs ) from Crohn ` s disease ( CD ) patients correlates with loss of tolerance against the host gut flora , leading to chronic inflammation .

What is needed for MMP proteins to be functional ?
0) Our results show that MMP genes are up-regulated prior to the induction of cytokines such as TNF-alpha , and that MMP proteins are prominent around blood vessels in LPS-induced neuroinflammation .
1) Matrix Metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are a family of 24 zinc-dependent proteases with the ability to degrade collagen and other extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins , which are important components of the cornea .
2) This function is supplied by matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) proteins , a large family of enzymes responsible for degrading a variety of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components and for modulating the bioactivity of transmembrane receptors and soluble factors .
3) In our recent study of the functional consequences of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 SNPs , we discovered that expression of a coding exon SNP in the pro-domain of the protein resulted in a profound decrease in the secreted protein .
4) MMP leads to the functional impairment of mitochondria and to the release into the cytosol of toxic proteins that are normally confined within the mitochondrial intermembrane space .
5) To better understand the role of subnuclear architecture in collagen and MMP expression , we mapped the osteoblast nuclear distribution of NP/NMP4 proteins and identified the functional motifs necessary for nuclear localization and nuclear matrix targeting .
6) Jawed vertebrates ( Gnathostomes ) have 4 tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) , multifunctional proteins that all inhibit members of the large matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) family but differ in their other roles , including the regulation of pro-MMP activation , cell growth , apoptosis and angiogenesis , and the structure of extracellular matrices ( ECMs ) .
7) These data underline the importance of functional interaction of MMPs with accessory proteins such as integrins during invasion , and the need for further studies to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of this process .
8) Recent growing evidence has established that MMP not only can degrade a variety of components of extracellular matrix , but also can cleave and activate various non-matrix proteins , including cytokines , chemokines and growth factors , contributing to both physiological and pathological processes .
9) Increased functional MMP activity , notably MMP-3 and -9 , is present in Crohn 's fistulas and may be inhibited by ramiprilate , a widely available ACE inhibitor .

What are the skeletal muscle satellite cells ?
0) Chicken skeletal muscle satellite cells are located between the basement membrane and the sarcolemma of mature muscle fibers .
1) The interactions of 125I-multiplication stimulating activity ( MSA ) and 125I-ovine somatomedin with receptors on skeletal muscle satellite cells are described .
2) The authors conclude that skeletal muscle satellite cells are committed to myogenesis and do not spontaneously adopt an adipogenic fate .
3) A plasma membrane glycoprotein common to embryonic chick myoblasts and adult chicken skeletal muscle satellite cells is the antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody C3/1 .
4) The proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells is regulated by multiple regulatory factors including non-coding RNAs .
5) Proliferating skeletal muscle satellite cells are the source of additional myonuclei which allow skeletal muscle to grow and regenerate .
6) Human skeletal muscle satellite cells are activated in response to both resistance and endurance exercise .
7) However , most studies have focused on the ability to transduce mature muscle cells , and have not examined the ability to target myogenic stem cells such as skeletal muscle satellite cells .
--------------------
Which is the execution time ( complexity ) of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for the alignment of two sequences
0) The problem of finding an optimal structural alignment for a pair of superimposed proteins is often amenable to the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm which runs in time proportional to the product of lengths of the sequences being aligned
1) While the quadratic running time is acceptable for computing a single alignment of two fixed protein structures the time complexity becomes a bottleneck when running the Smith-Waterman routine multiple times in order to find a globally optimal superposition and alignment of the input proteins
2) A modification of the Smith-Waterman algorithm is proposed which makes it possible to align the amino acid sequences obtained by formal translation of the starting nucleotide sequences by taking into account a possible shift of the reading frame
3) An algorithm for constructing a set of three to six alignments has been developed of which the accuracy of the best alignment exceeds on the average the accuracy of the best alignment that can be constructed using the Smith-Waterman algorithm
4) To infer homology and subsequently gene function the Smith-Waterman algorithm is used to find the optimal local alignment between two sequences
5) Sequence alignment is performed by pClust using the Smith-Waterman algorithm which is known to give optimal alignment and hence greater accuracy than BLAST-based methods
6) When running on structure-sequence alignment problems without long-range intersections i.e. C 0 the algorithm achieves the same asymptotic computational complexity of the Smith-Waterman sequence-sequence alignment algorithm
7) The technique is based on an extension of the Smith-Waterman algorithm that allows the calculation of sub-optimal alignments of a sequence against itself
8) To this end this study proposes the PAAVLS algorithm that follows the dynamic programming technique employed by the Smith-Waterman algorithm and largely reduces the demand of memory
9) Common solution to this problem is an employment of the BLAST that may miss significant alignments or an exhaustive Smith-Waterman algorithm that is very time-consuming
--------------------
Are adenylyl cyclases always transmembrane proteins ?
0) In mammalian cells there are many PDE isoforms and two types of adenylyl cyclases the G protein regulated transmembrane adenylyl cyclases tmACs and the CO/HCO/pH calcium and ATP-sensing soluble adenylyl cyclase sAC
1) The major mediators of CB 1 R are the G proteins of the G i/o family which inhibit adenylyl cyclases in most tissues and cells and regulate ion channels including calcium and potassium ion channels
2) The family of eukaryotic adenylyl cyclases consists of a very large group of 12 transmembrane adenylyl cyclases and a very small group of soluble adenylyl cyclase sAC
3) Soluble adenylyl cyclase sAC is a recently recognized source of the signaling molecule cyclic AMP cAMP that is genetically and biochemically distinct from the classic G-protein-regulated transmembrane adenylyl cyclases tmACs
4) Soluble adenylyl cyclase sAC is a widely expressed source of cAMP in mammalian cells that is evolutionarily structurally and biochemically distinct from the G protein-responsive transmembrane adenylyl cyclases
5) In mammals cAMP is produced by either the hormonally responsive G protein-regulated transmembrane adenylyl cyclases tmACs or by the bicarbonate and calcium-regulated soluble adenylyl cyclase sAC
6) The stimulatory alpha-subunit of trimeric G-proteins Galpha s which upon ligand binding to seven-transmembrane receptors activates adenylyl cyclases to produce the second messenger cAMP constitutes one of the archetypal signal transduction molecules that have been studied in much detail

How does thyroid hormone regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium ?
0) Our data suggest that Myc directly regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis in cardiac myocytes and is an important regulator of energy metabolism in the heart in response to pathologic stress
1) The transcription factors that regulate these changes in the setting of reduced PGC-1 are unknown but Myc can regulate glucose metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis during cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in cancer cells
2) PGC-1alpha a potent transcriptional coactivator is the major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and activity in the cardiac muscle
3) And inhibition of reactive oxygen species and enhancing the transcriptional network controlling mitochondrial biogenesis can mitigate the SO2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction
4) To identify transcriptional pathways regulated by CHF1/Hey2 we cultured primary neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes from wild type and transgenic mice overexpressing CHF1/Hey2 and treated them with serum a potent hypertrophic stimulus
5) Together our data indicate that hypoxia can stimulate the expression of PGC-1alpha and mitochondrial biogenesis in the cardiac myocytes and this process might provide a potential adaptive mechanism for cardiac myocytes to increase ATP output and minimize hypoxic damage to the heart
6) These data suggest a novel potential role of valsartan in modulating myocardial autophagy and mitochondrial turnover in renovascular hypertension-induced hypertensive heart disease which may possibly bolster cardiac repair via a blood pressure-independent manner
7) Melatonin ameliorates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in type 1 diabetic rats by preserving mitochondrial function role of AMPK-PGC-1α-SIRT3 signaling
8) Among physiological aspects of mitochondria that have been associated with neurodegeneration and may be interesting to investigate in Friedreich 's ataxia we can include mitochondrial dynamics and movement communication with other organelles especially the endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control
9) The Hippo-Yap pathway was originally recognized as a crucial signal cascade controlling organ size and more recently identified as an important component involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte survival proliferation and regeneration

What is the mechanism of cementogenesis in pulp regeneration ?
0) Since cementum regeneration is poorly understood we used a dog model of dental pulpal necrosis and in vitro cellular wounding and mineralization assays to determine the mechanism of action of calcium hydroxide Ca OH 2 in cementogenesis
1) Initiation of osteogenesis and cementogenesis is a problem central to periodontal regeneration
2) It is proposed that demineralization enhances cementogenesis the key to dentoalveolar healing by removing the smear layer barrier and exposing the organic component collagen fibrils of resected cementum and dentin
3) Cementum proteins role in cementogenesis biomineralization periodontium formation and regeneration
4) The geometry of the attachment apparatus of a tooth is important for the interpretation of the induction of cementogenesis with de novo Sharpey 's fibres as in thecodonty ie a tripartite attachment of alveolar bone periodontal ligament and cementum
5) This finding is in agreement with previous observations of tissue surrounding retrograde dentin-bonded composite fillings placed in monkeys indicating that tissue regeneration including cementogenesis may occur on composite material and consequently form a biological closure of the root canal
6) It has been shown that Emdogain Gel Emd-Gel containing enamel matrix proteins promotes biomineralization such as osteogenesis and cementogenesis during the regeneration of periodontal tissues
7) The TGF-βmight have been responsible for the induction of cementogenesis not only in extant P. ursinus but also in Diatectomorpha and mosasaurs thus providing continuous evolutionary mechanisms for the induction of tissue morphogenesis across animal phyla for almost a billion years of evolution epitomizing Nature 's parsimony in controlling tissue induction and morphogenesis
8) The presence of morphogenetic signals within the cemental matrix capable of inducing bone formation needs now to be assigned bone induction initiated by extracted and partially purified cemental matrices may be the result of a slow release of embryonic remnants of osteogenic signals required and deployed during cementogenesis
9) There is increasing evidence that the cells of the epithelial root sheath synthesize enamel matrix proteins and that these proteins play a fundamental role in cementogenesis and periodontal tissue formation
--------------------
Which are the subunits of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the canonical pathway activation ?
0) Inhibition of NF-kappaB by suppressing the canonical NF-kappaB activation pathway for instance by knockdown of the three subunits of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB I kappaB kinase IKK complex IKK1 IKK2 and NEMO triggers apoptosis in such cells
1) Here we show that dectin-1 expressed on human dendritic cells activates not only the Syk-dependent canonical NF-kappaB subunits p65 and c-Rel but also the noncanonical NF-kappaB subunit RelB
2) NF-κB can regulate the transcription of genes such as chemokines cytokines proinflammatory enzymes adhesion molecules proinflammatory transcription factors and other factors to modulate the neuronal survival
3) Recent molecular dissection of its mechanisms for activation has shown that NF-kappalB can be induced by the so-called canonical and noncanonical pathways leading to distinct patterns in the individual subunits activated and downstream genetic responses produced
4) Cells lacking IKKi are normal in activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway but fail to induce C/EBPdelta activity and transcription of C/EBP and C/EBP-NF-kappaB target genes in response to LPS
5) The canonical activation pathway of NF-kappaB is initiated by phosphorylation of the inhibitor by an IkappaB kinase IKK complex triggering ubiquitination of IkappaB molecules by SCF-type E3-ligase complexes and rapid degradation by 26S-proteasomes
6) IL-1β caused an activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways MEKK-1 regulated the activation of the canonical pathway while NIK regulated the activation of the noncanonical pathway
7) Upon activation of cells with tumour necrosis factor-alpha the CSN complex dissociates from IKK 's allowing full and rapid activation of the NF-kappaB pathway by the concerted action of interacting protein complexes
8) Here we show that 3-Cl-AHPC activated both IκB kinase IKK α and IKKβ with subsequent activation of the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways in the human breast carcinoma and leukemia cell lines
9) The C-type lectin dectin-1 activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB through a Syk kinase-dependent signaling pathway to induce antifungal immunity
--------------------
Which are the genes thought to be regulated by EWS / FLI ?
0) Here , we further investigated the regulation of PLD2 gene expression by EWS/Fli -1 and Fli-1 in another EWS cell line , and also in EWS/Fli -1 - or Fli-1-transfected cell line .
1) Apart from the chimeric oncoprotein that derives from the fusion of EWS and FLI genes , recent genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility variants near the EGR2 gene that regulate DNA binding of EWS-FLI .
2) Desmoplastic small round cell tumor ( DSRCT ) is defined by a chimeric transcription factor , resulting from fusion of the N-terminal domain of the Ewing 's sarcoma gene EWS to the three C-terminal zinc fingers of the Wilms ' tumor suppressor WT1 .
3) It was reported that short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) of EWS/Fli -1 downregulated phospholipase D ( PLD ) 2 in Ewing 's sarcoma ( EWS ) cell line , suggesting that PLD2 is the target of aberrant transcription factor , EWS/Fli -1 .
4) Recently , Ewing 's tumours have been shown to carry specific hybrid transcripts resulting from the fusion of the EWS gene with FLI-1 or ERG genes .
5) Results show that stable down-regulation of ETS1 increases the resistance of EWS cells to various genotoxic agents , whereas down-regulation of EWS/FLI -1 has pro-apoptotic effects .
6) We now report that , contrary to ETS1 , EWS/FLI -1 , an aberrant ETS transcription factor present in most EWS cells , is a negative effector of PARP transcription .
7) Using cell-based studies , we also establish that EWS cells are dependent on glutamine for cell survival and that EWS-FLI1 positively regulates expression of the glutamine transporter , SLC1A5 and two enzymes involved in the one-carbon cycle , MTHFD2 and MTHFD1L .
8) Less frequently , this gene fusion involves EWS and another member of the ETS family which can be : ERG , ETV1 , E1AF or FEV depending on the cases .
9) It has been shown that transduction of the gene EWSR1-FLI1 ( encoding EWS-FLI1 protein ) can transform NIH3T3 cells , and that mutants containing a deletion in either the EWS domain or the DNA-binding domain in FLI1 lose this ability .
--------------------
Which are the enzymes involved in the addition of 7-methylguanosine in mRNA ?
0) Among enzymes involved in ROS production or degradation , we found a specific reduction in thioredoxin-1 ( Trx-1 ) mRNA ( approximately 52 + / -7 % decrease , p < 0.01 vs control cells ) and protein ( approximately 60 + / -4 % decrease , p < 0.001 vs control cells ) levels in cells overexpressing REDD2 in comparison to control cells .
1) The creation of translation-competent mRNA is dependent on RNA polymerase II transcripts being modified by addition of the 7-methylguanosine ( m7G ) cap .
2) At least two decapping enzymes , Dcp2 and Nudt16 , and an array of decapping regulatory proteins remove the m ( 7 ) G cap from an mRNA exposing the 5 ' - end to exonucleolytic decay .
3) To identify the SeV protein ( s ) involved in mRNA cap methylation , we developed an in vitro assay system to detect mRNA ( guanine-7 - ) methyltransferase ( G-7-MTase ) activity .
4) Myc proteins also up-regulate translation by increasing addition of the 7-methylguanosine cap ( methyl cap ) to the 5 ' end of pre-mRNA .
5) In addition , significantly increased mRNA levels of histamine methyltransferase ( HMT ) , a key enzyme involved in histamine metabolism , were found in the SN and in the PU in PD .
6) mRNA level and enzyme activity of beta-amyrin synthase ( bAS ) , an oxidosqualene cyclase ( OSC ) situated at the branching point for oleanane-type triterpene saponin biosynthesis , were up-regulated by MeJA , whereas those of cycloartenol synthase , an OSC involved in sterol biosynthesis , were relatively constant .
7) The recent demonstration that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rai1 protein selectively hydrolyzes aberrantly capped mRNAs provides new insights into the modulation of mRNA that lack a canonical m ( 7 ) G cap 5 ' - end .
8) In particular , unlike cellular G-7-MTase , the SeV enzyme preferentially methylated capped RNA containing the viral mRNA 5 ' - end sequences ( GpppApGpG - ) .
9) The cap structure is formed by several activities and completed by RNMT ( RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase ) , which catalyzes N7 methylation of the cap guanosine .

Which protein interacts with the Ragulator-RAG GTPases to control mTOR activity ?
0) While NPRL2 interacts with Rag GTPases , RagD in particular , to interfere with mTORC1 activity in amino acid scarcity , NPRL2 interacts with Raptor in amino acid sufficiency to activate mTORC1 .
1) We find that the Rag proteins -- a family of four related small guanosine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) -- interact with mTORC1 in an amino acid-sensitive manner and are necessary for the activation of the mTORC1 pathway by amino acids .
2) Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) by amino acids is mediated in part by the Rag GTPases , which bind the raptor subunit of mTORC1 in an amino acid-stimulated manner and promote mTORC1 interaction with Rheb-GTP , the immediate activator .
3) Collectively , our results indicate that EtOH inhibits the anabolic effects that Leu has on protein synthesis and mTORC1 activity by modulating both Rag GTPase function and AMPK/TSC2/Rheb signaling .
4) mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) , a protein kinase complex , is the major target of rapamycin , and is a key element of evolutionarily conserved pathways that regulate cellular metabolism in response to environmental nutrients and intracellular energy status .
5) Ragulator is a GEF for the rag GTPases that signal amino acid levels to mTORC1 .
6) We identified SAMTOR , a previously uncharacterized protein , which inhibits mTORC1 signaling by interacting with GATOR1 , the GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) for RagA/B .
7) Here , we identify c17orf59 as a Ragulator-interacting protein that regulates mTORC1 activity through its interaction with Ragulator at the lysosome .
8) Mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) is a serine/threonine kinase that exists in two separate complexes , mTORC1 and mTORC2 , that function to control cell size and growth in response to growth factors , nutrients , and cellular energy levels .
9) Amino acids induce mTORC1 activation on lysosomes via the small Rag GTPases and the Ragulator complex , thereby controlling protein translation and cell growth .

How many periods of regulatory innovation led to the evolution of vertebrates ?
0) Neural crest cells are the primary innovation that led to evolution of the vertebrates and transcription factors of the SoxE family Sox8 Sox9 and Sox10 are among the central players regulating the development of these cells
1) The adaptive immune system has long been considered a key evolutionary innovation of the vertebrates the product of two rounds of genome duplication that gave rise to the raw material necessary for the evolution of a highly specific immune response and immune memory
2) Evolutionarily the neural crest is of interest as an important innovation in vertebrates
3) Three periods of regulatory innovation during vertebrate evolution
4) Until recently the lack of a proper Nt/Trk system in invertebrates has lead to the belief that they were a vertebrate innovation
5) For example the gecko adhesive system is a remarkable innovation that permits locomotion on surfaces unavailable to other animals but has been lost or simplified in species that have reverted to a terrestrial lifestyle
6) Early vertebrate evolution was characterized by regulatory gains near transcription factors and developmental genes but this trend was replaced by innovations near extracellular signaling genes and then innovations near posttranslational protein modifiers
7) The nearest invertebrate relatives of the vertebrates such as the ascidians sea squirts and amphioxus have only basic light detecting organs leading to the widely-held view that the vertebrate lens is an innovation that evolved in early vertebrates
8) This ventral grooved blubber directly relates to their intermittent lunge feeding strategy which is unique among vertebrates and was potentially an evolutionary innovation that led to gigantism in this lineage 1
9) The evolution of endothermy is one of the most significant events in vertebrate evolution
--------------------
Which are the state-of-the-art computational tools for the prediction of gene fusion events ?
0) Gene fusions are important genomic events in human cancer because their fusion gene products can drive the development of cancer and thus are potential prognostic tools or therapeutic targets in anti-cancer treatment
1) Despite the increasing quantity of tools for accurately predicting gene fusion candidates from sequencing data we are still faced with the critical challenge of visualizing the corresponding gene fusion products to infer their biological consequence i.e. novel protein and increased gene expression
2) Owing to the fact that location information can indicate important functionalities of proteins developing computational tools to predict protein subcellular localization is one of the most efficient and meaningful tasks with no doubt
3) Currently available computational tools which are many provide a researcher with the multitude of options for prediction of intrinsic disorder in a protein of interest and for finding at least some of its disorder-based functions
4) Using sequence and structure-based computational tools we performed in silico analysis on multiple polymorphic Macfas IgG and their interactions with human IgG Fc receptors FcγR thus predicting that Macfas IGHG polymorphisms influence IgG protein stability and/or binding affinity towards FcγR

8) Recent advances in the computational design toolbox which include new backbone re-design methods and the use of molecular dynamics simulations to better predict the catalytic activity of designed variants will further enhance the use of computational tools in enzyme engineering
9) To determine whether a non-synonymous SNP nsSNP in this gene affects its protein product we used certain computational tools which predicted two nsSNPs rs1801109 rs1801121 to have significant damaging effects
--------------------
Which is the definition of pyknons in DNA ?
0) Our analysis suggests that units of genetic information encoded in the linear sequences of the 3.6 billion bases of human genome are condensed in approximately 200,000 bases 0.006 of 5 UTR pyknons which are represented by hundreds of copies in a genome and utilized to build genome-unique sequences
1) Because of the association of pyknons with siRNAs and localization to silenced regions of heterochromatin we postulate that RNA-mediated gene silencing leads to the accumulation of gene sequences in non-coding DNA regions
2) Because the A. thaliana and human genomes have approximately the same number of genes but drastically different amounts of non-coding DNA these data reveal that pyknons represent a biologically important link between coding and non-coding DNA
3) Discovery of pyknons the most frequent variable-length DNA sequence motifs in the human genomes suggests extensive sequence-based connectivity between non-coding and protein-coding components of human genomes
4) Allele-specific sequence variations link disease-associated SNPs to distinct sets of pyknons and microRNAs suggesting that increased susceptibility to multiple common human disorders is associated with global alterations of genome-wide regulatory templates affecting the biogenesis and functions of non-coding RNAs
5) Pyknons are non-random sequence patterns significantly repeated throughout non-coding genomic DNA that also appear at least once among coding genes
6) Here we report identification of ubiquitous template design sequences templum intentio series templints of human genomes common for disease-associated SNPs microRNAs and pyknons
7) A. thaliana pyknons exhibit features similar to human pyknons including being distinct sequence patterns having multiple instances in genes and having remarkable similarity to small RNA sequences with roles in gene silencing
8) Human genome connectivity code links disease-associated SNPs microRNAs and pyknons
9) We propose the hypothesis that HIV-1 alters the structure-function relationship of chromatin coding DNA and non-coding DNA including RNA transcribed from these regions resulting in pathogenesis in AIDS drug abuse and NeuroAIDS

Which value of nuchal translucency thickness is set as the threshold for high-risk for Down Syndrome ?
0) The association between nuchal translucency thickness and risk of Down syndrome was firstly observed in high risk populations as an old maternal age or a history of a previous child affected by Down syndrome
1) An increased nuchal translucency NT thickness at 11 to 14 weeks gestational age is a common finding for Down syndrome Trisomy 18 and cardiac defects
2) The Down Syndrome Study Group DSSG was founded in 2012 as a voluntary collaborative effort with the goal of supporting evidenced-based health care guidelines for individuals with Down syndrome DS
3) On findings of prenatal ultrasonography nuchal translucency thickness was different between twins and suggested that one of the twins was at high risk for having chromosomal abnormalities including Down syndrome
4) What people with Down Syndrome can teach us about cardiopulmonary disease
5) Down Syndrome DS or trisomy 21 T21 is the most frequent and the best known malformation syndrome associated with mental deficiency that appears in human
6) While there is debate over issues involved in choosing between first and second trimester screening the most effective screening test for Down Syndrome is the integrated test based on the integration of the first trimester and the second trimester markers
7) Children with constitutional trisomy 21 cT21 Down Syndrome DS are at a higher risk for both myeloid and B-lymphoid leukaemias
8) One of these is the multidisciplinary Down syndrome team at the Alberta Children 's Hospital which provides assessment treatment and support based on established the Down Syndrome Medical Guidelines Cohen 1999 to children with Down syndrome
9) It has been shown previously that the absolute measurement of nuchal translucency NT thickness one of the most effective screening tests for fetal Down syndrome significantly decreases with increasing image size

Which kinase is inhibited by Tripolin A ?
0) Tripolin A , a novel small-molecule inhibitor of aurora A kinase , reveals new regulation of HURP 's distribution on microtubules .
1) One of the first bona fide cellular targets of TOR was the mammalian protein kinase p70 S6K ( p70 S6 kinase ) , a member of a family of kinases called AGC ( protein kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C-family ) kinases , which include PKA ( cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ) , PKG ( cGMP-dependent kinase ) and PKC ( protein kinase C ) .
2) Recently , phosphoserine was shown to be a particularly effective determinant for casein kinase I action when present in the motif - S ( P ) - X-X-S - ( Flotow , H. , Graves , P. R. , Wang , A. , Fiol , C. J. , Roeske , R. W. , and Roach , P. J. ( 1990 ) J. Biol .
3) Interestingly , Tripolin A affected the gradient distribution towards the chromosomes , but not the MT binding of HURP ( Hepatoma Up-Regulated Protein ) , a MT-associated protein ( MAP ) and substrate of the Aurora A kinase .
4) It has recently been shown that at relatively high molar ratios of myosin light-chain kinase ( MLCKase ) to calmodulin ( CM ) almost complete inhibition of the kinase activity occurs [ Sobieszek ( 1991 ) J. Mol .
5) In this study , from a panel of 105 potential small-molecule inhibitors , two compounds Tripolin A and Tripolin B , inhibited Aurora A kinase activity in vitro .
6) The dietary medicinal phytochemical withaferin A ( WA ) , isolated from Withaferin somnifera ( popular Indian name Ashwagandha ) , holds promise as a novel anti-cancer agent , which targets multiple cell survival kinase pathways , including IκB kinase/NF - κB , PI3 kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase amongst others .

--------------------
What is known as the cause of subacute thyroiditis ?
0) Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis ( SAT ) , also known as de Quervain 's thyroiditis or painful subacute thyroiditis , is the commonest thyroid condition responsible for neck tenderness .
1) As subacute thyroiditis is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in our community , the authors believe all people with hyperthyroidism should have a thyroid scan unless they have distinctive features of Graves ' disease .
2) Autoimmune postpartum and subacute thyroiditis , tumors that secrete thyrotropin , and drug-induced thyroid dysfunction , are also important causes .
3) de Quervain thyroiditis , also known as subacute thyroiditis , is a self-limited inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland .
4) Autoimmune postpartum and subacute thyroiditis , tumours that secrete thyrotropin , and drug-induced thyroid dysfunction , are also important causes .
5) Silent thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis are important causes of transient thyrotoxicosis from rapidly progressive tissue injury , followed by the release of thyroid hormone into the circulation .
6) Although the main mechanism of 131I uptake suppression in the thyroid gland in subacute thyroiditis is due to cellular damage and suppression of TSH release , our present findings suggest that IL-1 , TNF alpha , and IFN gamma produced in the inflammatory process within the thyroid gland further inhibit iodine incorporation and at least partly account for the decreased 131I uptake by the thyroid gland in destruction-induced hyperthyroidism .
7) Although the cause of subacute thyroiditis remains unclear , viral infection has been implicated in the onset of subacute thyroiditis in genetically predisposed individuals .
8) We speculate that the infection of the thyroid gland may cause subacute thyroiditis , a transient form of thyroiditis causing hyperthyroidism , resulting in changes in adrenocortical activity that could lead to hormonal dysfunction , thereby distinguishing the clinical presentation of rabies in the rabid host .
9) The term `` subacute thyroiditis '' has come to be applied to two rather distinct forms of inflammation of the thyroid gland , both of which run courses lasting several weeks to several months .
--------------------
The protein neprilysin has an positive effect on Alzheimer disease , how can it be delivered to the brain ?
0) A recent example is the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor which has success in the treatment of heart failure at least partly because of powerful blood pressure lowering properties .
1) AD is primarily a dementia-related disorder from progressive cognitive deterioration and memory impairment , while PD is primarily a movement disorder illness having three major kinesia or movement disorder symptoms , bradykinesia ( slowness of movements ) , hypokinesia ( reduction of movement amplitude ) , and akinesia ( absence of normal unconscious movements ) along with muscle rigidity and tremor at rest .
2) Brain neprilysin activity and susceptibility to transgene-induced Alzheimer amyloidosis .
3) Targeting the amyloid ( Aβ ) peptide cascade has been at the heart of therapeutic developments in Alzheimer disease research for more than 25 years yet no successful drugs have reached the marketplace based on this hypothesis .
4) We have introduced adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) expressing the mouse NEP gene into the hindlimb muscle of 6-month-old human amyloid precursor protein ( hAPP ) ( 3X-Tg-AD ) mice , an age which correlates with early stage AD .
5) Protein levels of neprilysin were reduced with age in the temporal and frontal cortex of AD and normal brain .
6) Tissue transglutaminase ( TGase ) has been implicated in neurodegeneration and can cross-link Abeta .
7) Expression of neprilysin in skeletal muscle reduces amyloid burden in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease .
8) Alzheimer disease ( AD ) is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration throughout the association cortex and limbic system , deposition of amyloid-β peptide ( Aβ ) in the neuropil and around the blood vessels , and formation of neurofibrillary tangles .
9) As an experimental gene therapy for AD , neprilysin gene was introduced in the hippocampus of mice using rAAV vector .

How is myotonic dystrophy inherited ?
0) myotonic dystrophy also called the Curschmann-Steinert syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscular dystrophy muscle weakness and myotonia which can affect both mother and child
1) The most common form of inherited muscular dystrophy in adults is myotonic dystrophy DM an autosomal-dominant disease caused by the expansion of an unstable CTG repeat sequence in the 3 untranslated region of the myotonin protein kinase DMPK gene
2) Children who inherit the autosomal dominant gene for myotonic dystrophy from their mother rather than their father may develop the severe neonatal type rather than the late onset type
3) The recent discovery of inherited unstable DNA sequences first in fragile-X mental retardation and now in myotonic dystrophy not only confirms that anticipation indeed has a true biological basis but provides a specific molecular mechanism for it this discovery can explain many of the puzzling anomalies in the inheritance of myotonic dystrophy and may prove relevant to comparable problems in other genetic disorders

Which protein is required for Argonaute 2 recruitment to stress granules and P-bodies ?
0) NRDE-2 associates with the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 within nuclei and is recruited by NRDE-3 / siRNA complexes to nascent transcripts that have been targeted by RNAi .
1) First observed in human cells , small RNA-induced gene activation , also known as RNAa , involves the targeted recruitment of Argonaute proteins to specific promoter sequences followed by induction of stable epigenetic changes which promote transcription .
2) Small regulatory RNAs including small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) and microRNAs ( miRNAs ) guide Argonaute ( Ago ) proteins to specific target RNAs leading to mRNA destabilization or translational repression .
3) These effector sites include the active site , to prevent target cleavage ; the binding groove , to modify nucleic acid binding affinity ; and surface allosteric sites , to control recruitment of additional proteins to form the RISC .
4) PRMT1 methylates the single Argonaute of Toxoplasma gondii and is important for the recruitment of Tudor nuclease for target RNA cleavage by antisense guide RNA .
5) As core components of the microRNA-induced silencing complex ( miRISC ) , Argonaute ( AGO ) proteins interact with TNRC6 proteins , recruiting other effectors of translational repression/mRNA destabilization .
6) Among these proteins are Argonaute 1 ( Ago1 ) and Argonaute 2 ( Ago2 ) , factors that are important for RNA silencing and whose interactions with A3G are resistant to RNase treatment .
7) siRNAs associate with the RNAi effector protein Argonaute 1 ( Ago1 ) , targeting the Ago1-containing RNA-induced transcriptional silencing ( RITS ) complex to homologous nascent transcripts .
8) At the heart of all small RNA-mediated silencing lies the key RNAi effector protein Argonaute , which once loaded with small RNAs can recognize its target transcript by siRNA-RNA Watson-Crick base pairing interactions .
9) Proper AGO1 and AGO2 recruitment to CD44 transcribed regions required the endonuclease Dicer and the chromobox protein HP1γ , and resulted in increased histone H3 lysine 9 methylation on variant exons .

Which are the newly identified DNA nucleases that can be used to treat thalassemia ?
0) The Dubai Thalassemia Center has identified 35 different beta-thalassemia mutations in 570 chromosomes from the United Arab Emirates population using gene amplification hybridization with specific labeled oligonucleotide probes sequencing of amplified DNA restriction enzymes and amplification refractory mutation system techniques
1) Realizing that a direct assay for the beta S gene already exists and that most cases of beta-thalassemia in Mediterraneans can be directly diagnosed using synthetic oligonucleotide probes we illustrate the above technique by examining nine DNA polymorphisms in the human beta-globin cluster for their ability to diagnose sickle-cell anemia in American blacks and beta-thalassemia in Mediterraneans
2) Analyses of DNA from 64 patients with thalassemia major using the hybridization technique of amplified DNA with radiolabeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes identified 13 different beta-thalassemia mutations
3) Although making a sequence-specific nuclease to enhance correction of a specific HBB mutation by homology-directed repair HDR is becoming straightforward targeting various HBB mutations of β-thal is still challenging because individual guide RNA as well as a donor DNA template for HDR of each type of HBB gene mutation have to be selected and validated
4) We have identified different beta-thalassemia mutations in 93 members of 34 families of Czech or Slovakian descent using gene amplification hybridization with specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes sequencing of amplified DNA and gene mapping
5) We propose antenatal blood tests using high-resolution DNA melting HRM analysis for beta thalassemia mutation detection after hemoglobin Aestimation as a modified strategy for the identification of beta thalassemia at-risk couples
6) Enzymes which fragment DNA at specific sites have been used to prenatally detect sickle cell anemia alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia from amniotic fluid aspirates
7) To facilitate the molecular diagnosis of uncharacterized patients with HPFH and delta beta thalassemia oligonucleotide primers have been designed to enzymatically amplify deletion-specific products for nine known deletions which include those responsible for HPFH-1 HPFH-2 HPFH-3 Spanish delta beta zero thalassemia hemoglobin Hb Lepore Sicilian delta beta zero thalassemia Chinese G gamma A gamma delta beta zero thalassemia Asian-Indian inversion-deletion G gamma A gamma delta beta zero thalassemia and Turkish inversion-deletion delta beta zero thalassemia
8) A method for diagnosis of alpha o thalassemia was developed based on detection of accumulated PCR product using SYBR Green I a double-stranded DNA binding dye and a fluorescence-detecting thermocycler
9) Importantly during the last years additional curative options for patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease are being developed based on the ability to manipulate the genome by employing programmable nucleases and next-generation genome-modifying tools thus providing the exciting prospects of targeted in-situ gene correction

Which diseases are associated with Alu element insertion ?
0) Although Alu insertions have been implicated in other diseases , and a closely related AluY element is found as an insert in the C1 inhibitor gene in patients with hereditary angioedema , this is the first case of glycerol kinase deficiency caused by an Alu insertion .
1) We found a disease-specific SVA ( short interspersed nuclear element , variable number of tandem repeats , and Alu composite ) retrotransposon insertion in an intron of the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 1 gene ( TAF1 ) , which encodes the largest component of the TFIID complex , and significantly decreased expression levels of TAF1 and the dopamine receptor D2 gene ( DRD2 ) in the caudate nucleus .
2) Mining the databases for putative retroposition-competent elements that share 100 % nucleotide identity to the previously reported de novo Alu insertions linked to human diseases resulted in the retrieval of 13 exact matches to the NF1 Alu repeat , three to the Alu element in BRCA2 , and one to the Alu element in FGFR2 ( Apert syndrome ) .
3) Ancestral DYT3 haplotype and disease-specific SVA ( short interspersed nuclear element , variable number of tandem repeats , and Alu composite ) retrotransposon insertion were identified in the DYT3 proband and two female unaffected family members .
4) Over the past decade , the insertion/deletion ( I/D ) polymorphism of a 287-bp Alu element in intron 16 of the ACE gene has attracted significant attention and has been extensively investigated in a spectrum of cardiovascular phenotypes , because of its correlation with serum ACE activity .
5) Although most of mobile elements are fixed within the human population , some elements ( including ALU , long interspersed elements ( LINE ) 1 ( L1 ) , and SVA ) are still actively duplicating and may result in life-threatening human diseases such as cancer , motivating the need for accurate mobile-element insertion ( MEI ) detection tools .
6) Mobile element insertions ( MEI ) have been identified as causes for genetic diseases , including hemophilia , neurofibromatosis , and various cancers .
7) Using the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) on genomic DNA isolated from patients with AMD ( n = 173 ) , and an age-matched control population ( n = 189 ) , we amplified a region polymorphic for an Alu element insertion in the ACE gene .
8) In this report , we studied a mutant CASR with an Alu-repetitive element inserted at codon 876 , which was identified in affected members of families with the hypercalcemic disorders , familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia ( FHH ) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism ( NSHPT ) , to understand how this insertion affects CASR function .
9) We have found 16 examples of diseases caused by the insertion of Alu elements , suggesting that they may contribute to about 0.1 % of human genetic disorders by this mechanism .

6) The recent findings that dysfunctional NAADP release leads to defective endocytic function which in turn results in secondary lipid accumulation in the lysosomal storage disease Niemann-Pick type C , is the first evidence of a direct connection between a human disease and defective lysosomal calcium release .
7) Gaucher disease , a prevalent lysosomal storage disease ( LSD ) , is caused by insufficient activity of acid β-glucosidase ( GCase ) and the resultant glucosylceramide ( GC ) / glucosylsphingosine ( GS ) accumulation in visceral organs ( Type 1 ) and the central nervous system ( Types 2 and 3 ) .
8) Gaucher disease , the most common lysosomal storage disease , can be treated with enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) , in which defective acid-beta-glucosidase ( GlcCerase ) is supplemented by a recombinant , active enzyme .
9) Loss of function mutations in mucolipin-1 ( MCOLN1 ) have been linked to mucolipidosis type IV ( MLIV ) , a recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by severe neurological and ophthalmological abnormalities .

What are the effects of depleting protein km23-1 ( DYNLRB1 ) in a cell ?
0) N-acetyl-D-glucosamine kinase ( GlcNAc kinase or NAGK ) primarily catalyzes phosphoryl transfer to GlcNAc during amino sugar metabolism .
1) We show that small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) depletion of km23-1 in human CRC cells inhibited constitutive extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) activation , as well as pro-invasive ERK effector functions that include phosphorylation of Elk-1 , constitutive regulation of c-Fos-DNA binding , TGFβ1 promoter transactivation , and TGFβ1 secretion .
2) Recently , it was shown NAGK interacts with dynein light chain roadblock type 1 ( DYNLRB1 ) and upregulates axo-dendritic growth , which is an enzyme activity-independent , non-canonical structural role .
3) Further , we have reported that the TGFβ receptor ( TβR ) - interacting protein km23-1 plays an important role in TGFβ signal transduction ( Jin , Q. , Ding , W. , and Mulder , K. M. ( 2007 ) J. Biol .
4) We established cell lines lacking WDR60 or TCTEX1D2 , both of which are dynein-2-specific subunits encoded by ciliopathy-causing genes , and found that both WDR60-knockout ( KO ) and TCTEX1D2-KO cells show defects in retrograde ciliary protein trafficking , with WDR60-KO cells demonstrating more severe defects probably due to failed assembly of the dynein-2 complex .
5) These results indicate that the NAGK-dynein interaction with the involvements of Lis1 and NudE1 plays an important role in prophase nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEB ) and metaphase MT-KT attachment during eukaryotic cell division .
6) Moreover , km23-1 depletion in human CRC cells reduced cell migration and invasion , as well as expression of the ERK-regulated , metastasis-associated scaffold protein Ezrin .
7) A proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) for NAGK and DYNLRB1 revealed NAGK-dynein complex on nuclear envelopes in prophase cells and on chromosomes in metaphase cells .
8) Here we examined the functional role of this signaling regulatory protein ( km23-1 ) in mediating the migration , invasion , and tumor growth of human colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) cells .
9) On the other hand , inhibiting the endogenous DYNLRB1 with gene-specific small interfering RNA or pharmacologically with a specific inhibitor ( vanadate ) led to a significant ( P < 0.05 ) decrease in folate uptake .
--------------------
Is the gene DUX4 epigenetically regulated in somatic cells ?
0) We found also that ectopically expressed DUX4 up-regulates the endogenous human FRG1 gene in healthy muscle cells , while DUX4 knockdown leads to a decrease in FRG1 expression in FSHD muscle cells .
1) The DUX gene family includes DUX4 , the intronless Dux macrosatellites in rat and mouse , as well as several intron-containing members ( DUXA , DUXB , Duxbl , and DUXC ) .
2) Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that DUX4 recruits p300 to its target gene , ZSCAN4 , displaces histone H3 from the center of its binding site , and induces H3K27Ac in its vicinity , but C-terminal deleted DUX4 does not .
3) One of the potential treatment options is the use of effective antisense oligonucleotides ( AOs ) to knockdown expression of the myopathic DUX4 gene and its downstream molecules including paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 ( PITX1 ) .
4) Recent molecular advances have identified a novel , clinically aggressive subgroup of undifferentiated round cell sarcomas defined molecularly by oncogenic fusion of the gene , CIC , and either DUX4 or its paralog , DUX4L , herein termed CIC-DUX sarcomas .
5) Fusion between CIC and DUX4 up-regulates PEA3 family genes in Ewing-like sarcomas with t ( 4 ; 19 ) ( q35 ; q13 ) translocation .
6) Individuals with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD ) have a partial failure of somatic DUX4 repression resulting in the presence of DUX4 protein in sporadic muscle nuclei .
7) Here we show that CIC , a human homolog of Drosophila capicua which encodes a high mobility group box transcription factor , is fused to a double homeodomain gene DUX4 as a result of a recurrent chromosomal translocation t ( 4 ; 19 ) ( q35 ; q13 ) .
8) Transgenic Drosophila for Investigating DUX4 and FRG1 , Two Genes Associated with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy ( FSHD ) .
9) Recently , in a subset of patients without D4Z4 repeat contractions , variants in the SMCHD1 gene have been identified that lead to hypomethylation of D4Z4 and thus DUX4 transcription , which causes FSHD type 2 .

8) Mutations in its encoding gene have been identified in patients with isolated non-compaction of the left ventricular myocardium , dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .
9) Isolated left ventricular non-compaction ( LVNC ) is a rare cardiomyopathy that leads to severe clinical complications .

Which drugs acting via bradykinin system are effective for treatment of ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema ?
0) Conclusion The efficacy of treatment of ACEI-induced angioedema with bradykinin antagonists , kallikrein inhibitor , and C1 inhibitor warrants further study .
1) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) , relatively new antihypertensive agents , act by blocking the formation of angiotensin II , a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone formation .
2) Three new treatments have recently become available : a kallikrein inhibitor that prevents bradykinin release , an antagonist of bradykinin receptors that blocks bradykinin action , and a recombinant human C1-INH molecule produced in transgenic rabbits that replaces the deficient protein .
3) Thus icatibant ( Firazyr ® ) , a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist , has proven to be an effective and more targeted treatment option and has been approved for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE .

8) Plasma-derived C1-INH , bradykinin receptor antagonists ( icatibant ) , kallikrein inhibitors ( ecallantide ) , or recombinant C1-INH is authorized on the market for HAE attack therapy or prophylaxis .
9) Although there is a small risk for anaphylaxis , which limits home administration , ecallantide is a novel , safe , effective and alternative treatment for acute HAE attacks .

2) Renal insufficiency vitamin B 12 status and population attributable risk for mild hyperhomocysteinemia among coronary artery disease patients in the era of folic acid-fortified cereal grain flour
3) This case of STEMI associated as it is with the use of a synephrine-containing product by a person without risk factors for coronary artery disease is to our knowledge the 1st reported in the literature
4) We conclude that these haemodynamic variations leading to an increase in EVR support the use of midazolam as a supplement to fentanyl anaesthesia for patients with coronary artery disease
5) The findings of the present randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial clearly support the efficacy of H. persicum fruit extract as a safe antioxidant supplement in subjects with minimal CAD
6) Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of use of these substances when young patients with no risk factors for coronary artery disease present with acute arrhythmias heart failure and myocardial infarctions

4) The AML1 gene also known as RUNX1 or CBFA2 located in chromosome band 21q22 encodes a transcription factor which heterodimerizes with the CBFbeta protein forming a complex called human core binding factor CBF
5) To address this problem we determined the crystal structure of the ternary complex containing Runx1 1-242 and Ets1 296-441 bound to T-cell receptor alpha TCRα enhancer DNA
6) As for the mechanism of the different roles of AML1 in the regulation of the c-mpl promoter we found that AML1 forms a complex with a transcription repressor mSin3A on the c-mpl promoter in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells although it forms a complex with a transcription activator p300 on the same promoter in megakaryocytic cells

Gene silencing can be achieved by RNA interference ( RNAi ) in eukaryotic organisms . What is the name of the analogous process in prokaryotic organisms ?
0) One of the first issues that emerges when a prokaryotic organism of interest is encountered is the question of what it is that is which species it is

What is the relationship between TailorX and Oncotype ?
0) Oncotype began as a commercial platform the company that produced it did not discover a signature but rather constructed it by asking users at every step what clinical question they wanted the signature to answer and what data would be credible in that regard
1) In this review we describe molecular risk scores for which tests are commercially available PAM50 MammaTyper MammaPrint Oncotype DX Endopredict Genomic Grade Index and IHC risk scores Mammostrat and IHC4 and discuss the current evidence of their clinical use
2) The introduction of US FDA-approved targeted therapy trastuzumab package insert changes irinotecan and tamoxifen and the initiation of a genotype-guided clinical trial for cancer therapy TYMS TSER in rectal cancer along with panels of DNA and expression markers Roche AmpliChip and Oncotype Dx panel are paving the way towards the integration of pharmacogenomics into clinical practice
3) Given that RS has an established strong relationship with prognosis and therapy responsiveness PhH3 may thus also be an important prognostic/predictive marker in breast cancer
4) The multi-gene expression-based assay Oncotype DX ODX is a genomic tumor profiling tool that determines the expression of 21 tumor associated genes it helps determine the risk for distant recurrence and whether chemotherapy is an appropriate course of treatment in patients with early stage estrogen receptor ER positive HER2 negative and lymph node negative or 1-3 positive lymph nodes invasive BCa
5) Oncotype DX is based on 17 genes and focuses on the ability to predict outcomes adverse pathology in very low-low and low-intermediate PCa patients while Prolaris is built on a panel of 46 genes and is validated to evaluate outcomes for patients at low risk as well as patients who are affected by high risk PCa and post-RP
6) So far Oncotype DX Genomic Health Inc. Redwood City CA USA Mammaprint Agendia Inc Huntington Beach CA USA the Breast Cancer Index BCI Biotheranostics San Diego CA USA and PAM50 Expression Analysis Inc. Durham NC USA are the only multigene assays that have been marketed in North America and Europe
7) At present four genomic tools are commercially available Decipher Oncotype DX Prolaris and ProMark
8) The 70-gene assay MammaPrint Agendia Netherlands and the 21-gene assay Oncotype DX Genomic Health USA are the most widely used breast cancer multigene classifier assays
9) PSA and derivatives PSA kinetics PSA density percentage of free PSA as well as algorithms based on PSA and PSA isoforms measurements prostate health index four-kallikrein score urinary molecular biomarkers-based tests Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 and the Michigan Health System Prostate Score and selected genomic/proteomic tests now commercially available for disease prognostication such as Confirm MDx Prostate Core Mitomic Test Oncotype DX Prolaris ProMark and Decipher are herein discussed to inform the readers about current and future clinical applications and their limitations

ROSIER scale is used for which disorder ?
0) The Swanson , Nolan , and Pelham Rating Scale ( SNAP-IV ) is a widely used scale that measures the core symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
1) I would like to hear from anyone who has used the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness scale ( PAIS ) or PAIS Self Report ( Derogatis and Derogatis 1983 ) on individuals with chronic illness , dermatological dysfunction , or any disorder involving visible body image [ Illegible word ] .
2) The children 's Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale ( CY-BOCS ) is a commonly used , psychometrically sound clinician-rated instrument of pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) severity .
3) The Sexual Compulsive scale ( SCS ) , Hypersexual disorder current assessment scale ( HD : CAS ) , Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Scale-self rating ( MADRS-S ) and Childhood trauma questionnaire ( CTQ ) , were used for assessing hypersexual behavior , depression severity and early life adversity .
4) Some of the rating scales being used in the adult population are the Conners ' Adult ADHD Rating Scales , the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale for Adults , the Wender Utah Rating Scale , the ADHD Rating Scale and ADHD Rating Scale-IV , the Current Symptoms Scale , and the recently-developed Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-v1 .1 Symptom Checklist .
5) Currently , there are three different scales that are most frequently applied : The International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale ( ICARS ) , the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale ( FARS ) and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia ( SARA ) .
6) The Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) is the most widely used scale for evaluation of clinical impairment in PD .
7) Five tremor severity scales ( the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale , the Bain and Findley Clinical Tremor Rating Scale , the Bain and Findley Spirography Scale , the Washington Heights-Inwood Genetic Study of Essential Tremor Rating Scale , and the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale ) , one ADL/disability scale ( the Bain and Findley Tremor ADL Scale ) , one quality-of-life scale ( the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire ) , and one screening instrument ( the Washington Heights-Inwood Genetic Study of Essential Tremor Rating Scale , version 1 ) are recommended using these criteria .
8) Several scales such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale ( CARS ) , The Autism Spectrum Disorder-Observation for Children ( ASD-OC ) , The Developmental , Dimensional , and Diagnostic Interview ( 3di ) , are available to aid in better assessing the behaviors and symptoms associated with ASD .
9) The parent and teacher ADHD-Rating Scale ( ADHD-RS ) includes inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales and is one of the most frequently used scales in treatment evaluation of children with ADHD .

What is known about MER41 repeat sequences ?
0) Annotations and the combined previously known and new 5,420 repeat sequences corresponding to 47 of the genome are available for download http://methdb.univ-perp.fr/downloads/
1) Because non-repetitive sequence including the same sequence as forward primer exists among these repeat sequences a pair of primers for the DYS389 locus give two amplification products DYS389 I and DYS389 II both of which are polymorphic
2) The dual role of DUS in transformation and as a structural component on RNA affecting transcription makes this a relevant model system for assessing significant roles of repeat sequences in biology
3) The only known repeat on this paternal sex ratio PSR chromosome is the 45S rDNA which includes here five different internal transcribed spacer 2 ITS2 sequences
4) A family of related sequences that includes approximately 500,000 members is the most prominent short dispersed repeat family in primate and rodent DNA 's
5) One of the most compelling reasons for the study of repetitive DNA sequence in the human genome has been the instability of simple repeat sequences associating with a growing and an interesting group of disorders affecting the neurological neuromuscular or developmental processes
6) Members of the NF-kappa B/rel family of transcription factors are regulated through a trans association with members of a family of inhibitor proteins collectively known as I kappa B proteins that contain five to eight copies of a 33-amino-acid repeat sequence ankyrin repeat
7) To address the question if plant simple repeat sequences are variable as in mammals GT n and CT n microsatellites were isolated from B.napus
8) These data argue that genetic variation is not as inhibitory to HIV-1 repeat deletion as it is to the corresponding cellular process and suggest that for sequences that differ by about 25 or more HIV-1 recombination directed by sequence homology may be no more frequent than that which is homology independent
9) Using biotinylated repeat oligonucleotides coupled with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and rapid single-pass hybridization we were able to enrich our plasmid library greater than two-fold for repeat sequences and increase the ability to link these ESTs with known sequences greater than six-fold
